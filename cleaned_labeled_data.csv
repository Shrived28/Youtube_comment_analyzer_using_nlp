"I couldn’t find Jhol on Apple Music, neither that nor Maand or any of the other popular tracks I used to vibe with. It feels like half my playlist has vanished overnight, likely due to bans now enforced in India. At first, it was frustrating. Music has always been a universal escape for me, a bridge across cultures and borders. But some lines, when crossed, demand a stance.

If this is what it takes to stand in solidarity with my nation, then so be it. My country comes first, always. As much as I’ve appreciated the artistry, I’ve made a clear choice. I will no longer listen to Pakistani songs. Some decisions are bigger than preferences, they’re about principles.",NEGATIVE

"How I love Ryan Renolds will always surprise me, I was just a kid in 2016 when I came across this Nasty comedic pool, half dead, When it changed Renolds life a completely, after that he became whats known as One role actor only, like Kevin Hart, in every movie he's just kevin hart and that never gets old, so is Renolds. 
I remember this trailer realising, watched it like 100 times, made a calender, waiting for the days to be crossed ASAP. and then the day arrived, when it got released. ASA it premiered I Turned off all the Social Media, to avoid coming across any spoilers, and then it happened, when I took my BSF with me to the movie he had no idea what was happening. he just laughed through all of it, I hope there's more to deadpool. But At the same time, I want his legacy to just Rest in its highest of time. Nonetheless, I'll forever love renolds, and keep his picture in my helmet (whenever going to a war) hehe.

"Dumbest movie ever. Hate superhero movies but loved Deadpool. This crap has ruined the first two movies for me. My girl likes twilight so I figured I’d let it play out. Even though I wasn’t willing to finish it after paying for it. 

Still couldn’t do it. I left the room with an hour left of the movie. Pointless fighting and marvel bs. The first 20 minutes are worth the watch. After that, I think the average American could justify why drugs or debt or getting into a car wreck is a better use of your time.",NEGATIVE

Marvel should add a world where all marvel characters are only in comics and movies.

"Dunno who is gonna read this, but I'll share my real personal experience I've had with this movie. I remember this trailer coming out. I was at the lowest point in my life, thinking about s**de and had no will to continue trying fixing my life and pulling myself together. I remember texting my friend about these thoughts and him being really worried about me and his constant signs of concern. He was really trying to help which I'm thankful to him for. Then this trailer came out and suddenly I realized that I really really needed to see this movie and how could I see it if I ended everything back then? So, I told myself that I would try my best to live the following 6 months before the movie premier and that I would go and watch this movie and have amazing time. And I did. I went to see that movie with my friends whom I really appreciate and thankful for being there for me. And I thank you, D&W, for keeping me alive and giving me a small goal to live for. By the time I watched the movie I had already put my life together. I'd fixed my schedule, started going to the gym, quit the job I hated, been much more open to my family and it's just feels amazing now. I doubt that Ryan or anyone else who's been behind of making this movie will read this, but nonetheless, THANK YOU. U really did save my life!",POSITIVE

Literally when this trailer was shown in that room, the chairs always moved along with the beat of ""Like a Prayer"". I knew that meant it was going to be a great time for the movie.

"Rewatching Deadpool 3, or as many call it, “Deadpool and Wolverine,” makes it clear that the film is essentially an exaggerated egotrip by Ryan Reynolds. The actor, producer, writer, presenter, entrepreneur, and comedian seems to use the film as a personal showcase, saturating every scene with his extremely forced persona.

The first movie of the franchise is acceptable, the second one starts to get tiring, but the third provokes deep antipathy—not so much toward the character, but toward the actor. Reynolds pushes his irreverence to the limit, turning the film into an egocentric indulgence where he delights in himself.

The plot is chaotic and seems to exist only to make room for an endless string of jokes. The storyline takes a back seat so that Deadpool’s character can monopolize the screen with shallow sarcasms that add nothing new. The presence of other iconic characters feels like nothing more than an excuse to boost Reynolds’ personal show, as if the movie were an awkward fanfic where he is the absolute protagonist.

Hugh Jackman’s return as Wolverine seems like a marketing ploy to attract audiences, but in the end, viewers are met with endless dialogues of inflated ego. What could have been an interesting interaction is lost in forced, unsubstantial lines.

In short, Deadpool 3 is a dull, tiresome, and pretentious film. Little entertainment, lots of irrelevance, and, above all, too much Ryan Reynolds. If I had to rate it, it would be a 3.5/10. It’s not a film worth watching more than once.",NEGATIVE

"Worst Marvel movie made b/w 2015 to 2024.
Marvel wanted to make some money from more populated countries. So they built it",NEGATIVE
"Absolutely not the movie I expected at all, for those of you wanting to see this I know you will. But honestly its not even what FOX wanted it to be back in 2016. Its sad to me that Disney puts out garbage like this where every sentence contains the ""F"" bomb or ""MF"" bomb I can take the cussing but it truly shows the lack of directing and writing skill that play into an unintelligent writer and director. This is not a superhero movie at all and it doesn't even tell a story line its actors that put on costumes we all know and were dropped a script to sell their soul for a buck. I am disappointed in Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds, Not to mention Jennifer Gardner.  All 3 of these actors said they were proud to make a movie their kids could watch, what a joke! Do not waste your money on Amazon for 24.99 bucks wait for it to decrease, and if you let your kids watch this then you aren't watching your kids. Marvel you should be ashamed of letting your franchise be destroyed by this crap of a Studio.",NEGATIVE

I don't see anyone that's not a Marvel Fanboy enjoying this movie. Ive been following the Marvel Movies because of the hype...

Even Sylvester Stallone’s Samaritan superhero movie is more appealing.,NEGATIVE

Just got back from watching this trash. Wasted time! There were a few funny scenes but I would rather spend 10 minutes watching them on YT or something. A movie for the modern generation of schoolers. Not worth if you are over 15 years of mentally developed age. First Deadpool movie is where it should have ended. This is only gonna make me think not twice but three times before going to a cinema next time. It was the first time after 5 months that I visited cinema after doubting even going there and I should’ve listened my gut. I would’ve rather spent time at home watching some movie from the 90s or 80s that I haven’t yet seen. I will never trust any comment on the new movie as they seem to be either generated by AI or at&pid kids. This is the world we live in today. Another 👎 movie!,NEGATIVE

"As Christians we should boycott this movie and any other movies as well for the matter that they deliberately mock/blaspheme/defame the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 

Why do you think they always choose to mock Jesus and not any other religious leaders such as Muhammed or Buddha or Gurunanak or Khrisna or anyone else???? Why? 

Is it because the Devil (Satan) who runs hollywood knows that Jesus is the only true Savior of mankind? and therefore by making fun/mocking/defaming Him, people would then not take Jesus seriously? and therefore if they don't take Jesus seriously, then they would not believe in Him for their salvation? and if they don't believe in Jesus, then they would end up in a place called Hell where the Devil (Satan) knows very well that it's the place he will be tortured for eternity by God? 

Think about it, dear friends.
The Devil's most important agenda is to destroy human being's souls for he came to kill, steal and destroy. 
But Jesus came to heal, restore and save our precious souls.",NEGATIVE

Guess I was the only one who thought this movie sucked. One of the laziest storylines of any Marvel movie. The fighting scenes all felt the same to me.

"I fell asleep, then I wish I had stayed there. That running Deadpool speech is tiresome. I just don't get this talky movie. Maybe if I had been 12, and allowed to watch it if not for all the vulgar language. It had some interesting action scenes but the music choices were strange and they chopped up the movie in between the never-ending rambling about nothing with that whiny irritating voice from an actor who is often brilliant. Maybe it was written during the writers' strike. Why? Why?
I just thought of one thing which could have helped as I was at a complete loss earlier. Maybe choose a great song as a theme (it's hackneyed but the idea is coming...) and that becomes a running joke. When the character gives the line and the look we know the theme song is coming. Another character can even give an ""oh brother, not again"" expression. And when the character is revved up for a fight and the music starts someone else can direct him ""not now"" and the music cuts. Or the character searching for identity and greatness can search for a theme song and the other characters can critique it. ""You actually hear that? I thought it was in my head"", ""Of course I can hear it. I'm not deaf and your music choices are disturbing"" kind of thing.
Maybe since the movie was so talky the dialogue could be really high level meaning of life philosophy. And the characters would be on the move instead of standing around arguing. It doesn't have to be linear and real. They could be walking on a different plane of existence while having these esoteric conversations and you'd have to get some experts to give you the material. It's a movie and it's not real anyway so you can suspend the reality even more to make it interesting. Often the best innovation, the aha moment, comes from pulling rabbits out of hats to fix a problem.",NEGATIVE

"Movie was horrible, Blade and Electra, heck even X-men at times is a dark mysterious ruthless movie, but some how this Deadpool movie messed it all up, the best thing about Blade and Electra was their walk in, fight scenes sucked. This movie needed to be ten times darker, vengeful with a world full of characters pissed off. Felt like some Musical for the family, these characters suppose to the working class adults escape, and it didn’t feel that freaking way. To darn bright, the movie PITCH BLACK seemed darker and it was on a world with 3 suns. Total waste of money, to watch and make!!!",NEGATIVE

Scarlett gets along with her costars. Scarlett was amazing in black widow and the advengers.... but yeah Blake being the ""lady deadpool"" was so forced and pathetic
Scarlett Johansson is a natural beauty. Whereas Blake Lively had to get a nose job to be a 5 out of 10, go watch ""sisterhood of the traveling pants"" to see her old big nose 😅 😂",POSITIVE

This is ridiculous. Pointless battles. Too many universes too many heroes mixed together for no reason. The whole movie was a mess. The storyline it does not make sense. Batman and catwoman superman and joker from DC universe was absent from this chaos of a movie. It felt like a parody instead of a movie. Sheer disappointment.

I'm kinda late watching this trailer for the newest deadpool movie and it looks awesome. I have always been a marvel fan since I was a teenager and I've always been a fan of the original xmen movies and wolverine too. I heard that there are lot of cameos in it. I will watch this when it hits some free streaming apps and I know that will be a long wait but I'm fine with that. I should watch deadpool 2 and watch the rest of logan as well.,POSITIVE

"Deadwood disrespected original wolverine by digging up his remains and throwing him about like a rag doll. Makes a mockery of everything we have seen him go through over the last 24 years...all that fight and a noble death, just to be dug up and thrown about.

"IT'S A VERY DISSAPOINTNG A AWFUL MOVIE , I wacthed a few hours ago, omg, what a horrible introduction, it was quite hard to understand why Deadpoo was looking for  Logan and why  and what happeded to the world.

The movie is extremely boring and has a very pity action, the plot and the script , the narrive or storytelling , the context are a mess, poor and  added randomly, I  wasn't able interesting things from both characters who of course were not explored or developed  during the movie.

The whole movie itself is a chaos, it  wasn't well structured, defineed , contextualized and well plot ,  with different scenarios



The fights with enemies are too short obvious and boring, the  humor is basically always the same, just references and offenses.

The enemy has/had no flashbacks or explanations of her origins, I was like wtf how can you introduce an enemy that way ?.

It is  like teaching kids without words or vocab, it was a total deception.




I really deel disappointed, but well, I hope they can improve the way they make movies much better, with better trills, concepts, characters, flashbacks of the enemies and much better introductions rather than danding bye bye bye from NSYnc , I am pretty sure that a good  intro about what happened to the world, to the people, and the importance of saving humanity through something explained elaborately could have been better by far.",NEGATIVE

Deadpool 3 is the Greatest movie ever made definitely the movie of the year.,POSITIVE
My favorite thing in this movie is how they destroyed the character of Cassandra nova. The super old lady with the ringle dead expression face turned to the most generic bald chick ever 😂 no wonder why people watching these movies think she is the ancient one from dr stange movies..i mean its two bald women 😅 pretty much the same stuff. At least they could give the role to an older woman but its hollywood. People want their cassandra Nova young with a flawless skin and wolverine extra ripped and tall.

I’m watching today so excited 😆,POSITIVE
"I saw this Movie yesterday PARENTS BEWARE Let me be clear I am a Superhero Fan and have enjoyed the Deadpool series to this point. Good vs Evil where Good always wins is heart felt. This bastardization of that theme was gratuitously raunchy filled with way too many sexual innuendos. Granted its was funny when injected sparingly but this was over the top. Parents should know this is non stop lude and lascivious behavior. Add to that non stop killing beyond what you would see in a Horror Film granted excellent special effects awesome CGI but again gratuitous over the top non stop killing. It was as if on purpose to illustrate how absurd movies of this type are. A satire of sort's. I felt bad for the parents who brought their children to see it. I actually saw a group get up and leave. IMHO it is a sad day when someone thinks this is Family entertainment. I know I know I understand the ratings system an ""R' means don't take kids but we all know that is sometimes ignored and Deadpool/Superhero movies are some of those many would. Bottom line this is a Stag Party movie shame on Disney for abusing there persona. I've resisted canceling them in the past but as much as I hate doing it they are dead to me now.",NEGATIVE
Deadly combo,POSITIVE
"I'm so glad i didn't watch this beforehand, it's a good trailer but a lot of the scenes in it just hit different seeing them in theater",NEGATIVE
"A movie for ""nerds"" as Deadpool himself says during the movie, who are these nerds? All the people in the theater were regular people. Maybe try to make a movie for the average guy and not to please 3 idiots on reddit.",NEGATIVE

"Just got back from the movies. Wont give anyway spoilers but To understand the movie better make sure to watch Loki, Logan, and the original x men movies. And of course deadpool 1 and 2. Youll be a bit lost imo if you are going into this without seeing those movies.",POSITIVE
"Deadpool is a better Wolverine than Wolverine. 

I hope next time we get a Wolverine that can actually fight. Shoot, John Wick had better fight scenes than all of the Wolverine movies.",POSITIVE

"Honestly the best duo in the MCU ""f*** the avengers” lol all joking aside Deadpool’s over the top behavior and big mouth with Wolverines temper and grumpiness is what makes them great",POSITIVE
"Walking home from the theatre right now, saw the film, it was fun! I appreciate this film existing. Some jokes were hit or miss, but that’s not a major complaint. I liked a lot of the fight scenes.",POSITIVE

"2:36: I love the ""THIS FILM IS NOT YET RATED"" addition to rope in the Midwest soccer moms with purses full of bags of wine who might've watched/heard the entirety of the trailer as if there was a possibility that this could be anything but a *hard* R-rated MCU movie. 

""Mom, can we go see the new superhero movie? It's not rated, so it's fine!""

"Do not waste your money, this is literally the worst movie I have ever watched, I felt like leaving early but I thought it would be awkward. I have never watched these X-men before. It looks like you are supposed to watch the old movies first. I expected a superhero movie like Batman or Superman. But it is actually a comedy movie that parodies itself. They do not bother to explain what the multiverse is or any of the backstory. The movie is loaded with references to past movies in this series, none of which make sense. The actors speak into the camera and speak directly to the viewers and take jabs at rival movie studios, very meta. That was mildly fun, like, haha, ok, whatever.

I am uncertain if the movie had a story. I struggled not to fall asleep at one point. Something about preventing the destruction of a universe. The path to the ending seemed to be a string of comedy sketches that were not well connected. I guess the fan base must be in their 40s because they played a few old 80s hits for no good reason.

This series seems to have a fan base of sorts. Don't kill me, this is just how I experienced the movie.",NEGATIVE
"I just came out of the movie and I have to say in all honesty, this movie didn't disappoint...to disappoint. Marvel is an absolute mess and I can't believe I fell for this crap again. I was cringing for most of the movie.",NEGATIVE

Not a chance Ryan just got the green light to make anything he wants now with who ever he wants they'll be chucking money at him by the truck load.

When the cameos started honestly wow i just wanted more and more. The only thing they could have done was at the end when we got 100 dead pools was we got 100 characters from the fox universe instead. Dead pool could have done an avengers asemble rip off but with fox characters.",POSITIVE

"To be honest, I don't like this film very much, it still funny and I used to really like X-men, but some of the characters last appeared on screen about 10 years ago, and I was hardly impressed with them, and with the plot this movie just copied the old famous scenes. The characters are hollow, especially the 2 villains, they appeared and were defeated in a rather silly way. I mean the script is pretty bad, like recent marvel movies. 
I'm starting to get tired of movies being made just to serve as an introduction to the characters in Avenger 5 and 6 and not being able to understand without watching the other movies about each characters first, or having forgotten them all. This movie literally just introduces old characters are coming back and possibly will appear in Avengers 5. There are no feelings left in me after watching the movie.",NEGATIVE

"Spoilers ahead.

1.) The timeline in some Marvel films is incorrect. Like in the movie Deadpool 2, when Deadpool goes to Xavier Mansion, we are shown the younger form of Charles Xavier, Quick Silver, Beast, Cylops in a room, the same form which was shown to us in X-Men Apocalypse, Dark Phoenix i.e. the year 1983. But in the movie Deadpool 2, the year 2018 is going on.

2.) The year 2023 is shown in X-Men Days of Future Past and the year 2029 in Logan. So have Professor X and Logan become so old in just 6 years? In Deadpool 3, Deadpool tells Wolverine that you are very respected in my world. You was the X-Man, you was the main X-Man, The Wolverine. Was...means Wolverine is dead now. In Deadpool 3, the year is 2024, so Logan will die after 5 years.


Marvel is confused about timeline.",NEGATIVE
"I have always been a fan of Avengers and X-men series but unfortunately this is the worst movie they have ever made.

Trying to turn violence into humor, mockery of christians, (Marvel Jesus), heavy emphasis on LGBTQ agenda.

I really regret spending time and money on this nonsense that promotes non values! 😏

What you will see in a few words:

Stabbing genitals, lots of bloody scenary, bad taste of humor. Really disgusting experience!

The only positive review I can mention is Wolverine's attitude towards the ridiculous stupid behaviour of Deadpool.

I will be more cautious before going to another Marvel movie! Far from what I was expecting! 😟",NEGATIVE

Ya no hay entretenimiento, sino que se trata de promover todo lo que va en contra de Dios.

"For me, the movie is either a 8/10 or a 9/10. The humour and soundtrack were great... but, if I had to criticize anything, I would say I wished there were more MCU cameos, (but I guess I'm just a greedy MCU fan) some of the side characters were a bit 2-dimensional, but, even then, the main characters were pretty good. Oh, and the special effects and acting were good and the emotional moments were decent.

So, yeah, if you liked or loved the first 2 Deadpool movies and the other marvel movies, I'd say go see this. Oh, and make sure you've seen the first season of Loki... that got referenced quite a bit.",POSITIVE

"What if this Wolverine went back in time like in DOFP but sided with Magneto instead? This may have resulted in the end of mutant kind in the future and a new timeline in which mutants have dominance over nonmutants with Magneto as the ruler. Consequently, Logan has let down his entire world. Things change for the worst and he becomes a loner. Maybe the nonmutants develop Sentinels either way and mutants get exterminated in both timelines or maybe Logan grows distant because of his conflict with Eric. If nonmutants won again then they clearly let Logan go.",NEGATIVE

If you turn the volume all the way up as soon as the trailer starts you can hear someone say “One of the Avengers just walked in here” and that lines up because Wade just approaches Logan, and he sees the suit and automatically thought it was Wanda Wilson hence why he said Lady, he probably thought “She” was tryna recruit him to the Avengers.",POSITIVE

I am not interested in a bromance movie between deadpool and wolverine if there is no wade and vanessa anymore . their relationship was one of the best parts of the first movie . it humanized and softened wade so he wasn’t completely just obnoxious. they then killed her off in two which sucked but then brought her back to life which was awesome .

Scott Eastwood.

Better facial structure and Jawline to fill Captain America’s mask, suit, shield and most importantly, shoes. Give him the same direction as they did Evans. And you mayhaps saved the Captain’s mold.

Far Way better than Wyatt Russel to fill the role and to turn out looking like the man from Disney’s “Up”, in Cap’s suit.",NEGATIVE

They should've had Mangold direct. I know this Shawn Levy is like his producing partner and seems to direct all his movies now but I want that gritty Logan type script with a little less Deadpool quips and dropping in ADR of one of 10 jokes they decided on for his line. But I guess Levy has proven himself as a capable director. It'll be interesting.,NEGATIVE

Glad we get one last (?) watch of Hugh Jackman as prime Wolverine. Hopefully there’s more action sequences with him involving him stabbing and getting stabbed as I’ve never felt there was a scene in the franchise that was dedicated to just him going crazy killing people.

"FINALLY: The Wolverine we always wanted! At least from the trailer. All these years and being that Hugh    is the perfect actor for Wolverine. They never presented him in true form. To paraphrase; They have always ""whisky d*ked"" the use of his claws in every film! No real grit. Hoping this movie changes that. We need more Wolverine movies Hugh.

This is not some Marvel movie you take your little Jimmy to see simply because it has the Marvel Studios logo on it.

"Calling it now, this movie is going to disappoint. It will be flawed, basic, and annoying at times. I guarantee you, despite a few ""cool/viral scenes"", it will cement the slow decline of the franchise in terms of storytelling, dark humor, and wtf factor. This will easily rank as the worst movie in the franchise - both in terms of audience ratings and financial performance. 100% guaranteed on 5/11/24.",NEGATIVE

"The producers waited too long to make another sequel.
Six years...

Reynolds has stated this is his last time as DP.

The First 2 movies did something different, a super hero film that went its own way, outside of the "" hero trope"" box....

This film seems to conform to the same trope formula it was rebelling against...

Deadpool didn't need a "" side kick"" or Any help.

He didn't need or want to join the X Men!

Deadpool with Hulk or Captain America  would have been bigger!

Deadpool vs Venom or Morbius would have been cool..

Why DP and Wolverine??

Anyway, I probably won't pay to see this since it will be on demand by mid summer.",NEGATIVE
"That intro is so much the more poignant because i've seen guys like that, and they were presumably not able to heal all wounds within seconds. 'just one more drink, then i'll go home' bouncer comes to kick them out, and it's the threat of a fight makes it the happiest you've seen them all year (to paraphrase a different thing 'I want to hurt someone. Myself, probably')
Even the 'you don't want this' warning - a bad drunk who knows they're about to fight, and knows it's wrong, so gives a warning, just to make sure everyone knew they were okay being hauled out by the police after trying to headbutt security. Probably wanting the warm safe bed that comes with a cell",POSITIVE
About to be the best movie since No Way Home,POSITIVE
"And that was me disqualifying, cancelling, wiping away, de-indexing, closing, ignoring, yelling, yawning at every single suggestion of that trailer as yet another quality fan-made trailer, believing Jackman was (sadly) a man of his word when it came to Logan's ultimate fate in the film of the same name, that happened to be one of the most disturbing, obscure and mature iterations of the franchise's darkest timeline yet.

And then, I watched. And my mind exploded. Texting and sending frenetic audios to all my fan friends that laugh back at me since I'm SO late to the party.

I clicked on this trailer posted on a non-official channel believing I would at least enjoy a quality artist view of what ""could have been in another Earth"". I dreamed, hoped, waiting, thought, obsessed so many times, in so many forms, for so many years, randomly googling any piece of news that could have the slightest connection to such a revival that I had somehow completely made peace with leaving the most glorious past where it belonged, behind us, with our best memories to cherish about it. 

And suddenly, the OFFICIAL Wolverine jumped, roared, swore, drank, was such a marvelous piece of tortured trash again and then shined on the savage battlefied, with non other than Reynold's Deadpool.

This cannot be real. 

Yet, it is.

I , LOVE, MY, SILLY, DAY.",POSITIVE
1:40 20th Century Fox 😂,POSITIVE
Finally. Marvel is back at it again.,POSITIVE
"Technically it wasn’t Wolverine that messed up the whole world, just the X-men, no thanks to mr. Sinister and Mysterio. It was really the company Essex that was responsible for wiping out most mutants in Logan. They laced the world’s food supply with a specialized sugar that has an anti- mutant antigen.",NEGATIVE
"Okay, now I'm happy.  After this please let Hugh Jackman do no more Wolverine stuff except maybe voice work.  This is (hopefully) the high note that caps his retirement of the character in style.",POSITIVE

"This is simply everything fans ever wanted. It only took (checks watch) how many decades? Give it up for Hugh, the man is 55-years-old and still looks ridiculously amazing as Wolverine. I will gladly watch Ryan Reynolds subvert every possible film rating and studio notes, for however long he wants to play Deadpool. Given the tech these days, he could easily do it for another 20 - 30 years, and I'd have no problem with that. Then again, he seems to be the only one who *gets comic fans,* and he'd be my Board Vote to lead a studio any day. He's proven he can do it. Take my money, Ryan, any day, it's always entertaining, and that's all we want.",POSITIVE

"My hypothesis is that the deadpool & wolverine movie starts the old men logen comic plot and takes place before the logan movie. (prequel)

"WAIT A MINUTE, Is that Dr Strange's portal?😮",NEGATIVE
I have a feeling they’re using Antman and Dr. Strange aspects in this film to absolutely rip into their recent films. Nova is clearly using Antmans dead body as her fortress and we see the Strange portal at the end so I can only assume Ryan Reynolds is going completely bash those two films for failing to make the timeline/variant/multiverse films we fans expected.,NEGATIVE

"In an interview with The Associated Press, Levy explained why Deadpool & Wolverine was made to be as accessible as possible. ""I was a good student in school. I’ll do my homework as an adult. But I am definitely not looking to do homework when I go to the movies,"" he said. ""I very much made this film with certainly a healthy respect and gratitude towards the rabid fan base that has peak fluency in the mythology and lore of these characters and this world. But I didn’t want to presume that. This movie is built for entertainment, with no obligation to come prepared with prior research.""",POSITIVE

"RDJ was asked about returning as Iron Man earlier this month annnd said, ""That role changed me. And look, I always say never, ever bet against Kevin Feige, he always wins, you'd lose the house."" 

Russo Brothers followed up with ""I mean we closed that book, it would up to them to figure out how to reopen it""

Deadpool refers to his self as Jesus and the MCU's saviour.

The car with the badge is Red Skulls

Rob Liefeld has agreed with a tweet on X/Twitter that proclaims the post credit scene is mind blowing.

The tagline is ""Everyone deserves a happy ending!""

My theory is after half a dozen fake outs throughout the movie, during the post credits scene, RDJ makes an appearance, says nothing, cuts to black, white lettering appears on screen....


IRON MAN WILL RETURN!!!

Setting him up for his eventual appearance in Avengers Secret Wars",NEGATIVE
Can we get a deadpool with the katanas coming out the arms like in x men origins,NEGATIVE

"Who else got chills when Wade said: ""you were an x-men...you were THE x-men."" ? I grew up watching the original animated series and really only cared about Logan's origin stories and what that brought to the x-men universe. To see him being used to bridge the MCU into the x-men universe is everything.",POSITIVE
"It feels like it has been many years now but I vaguely remember this feeling. The excitement for an upcoming marvel project that actually looks good.
With 345k likes to 3.1k dislikes it seems others feel the same way. 
Something recent from Marvel not actually getting ratio'd into the ground who would have thought.",POSITIVE

Who’s screaming “YEAH” at the end??,NEGATIVE
"Is that, is that wolverine from the timeline where all the villians group up and act smart? Where the villians kill, turn, or incapacitate every hero? Because I think I have that comic, and this sounds like that wolverine.",NEGATIVE
The songs from 90s and before are really something.,POSITIVE

What's the name of the song?,POSITIVE
Best movie ever and it's just a trailer.,POSITIVE
"I don't think it will be his last time Hugh's playing him, honestly. From what I gage this is a wolverine we've never met who's been living in the MCU but failed and hid in shadows for ages or something. If they're going into Dr. Strange's or Wong's portal at the end, I doubt whatever the plot is will be covered entirely in just this film.",NEGATIVE
"This is going to be amazing, some drama is about to down😂😂😂😂",POSITIVE
"""This Wolverine let down his entire world""-Paradox 
Paradox is sort of right in some timelines Logan succeeds saving X-Men and mutant kind while other timelines he doesn't succeed and fails. 
""There’s a theory in quantum physics that time is immutable it’s like a river you can throw a pebble in and create a ripple but the current always corrects itself. No matter what you do the river just keeps flowing in the same direction""-Hank/Beast
What if the X-Men are always meant to die in every timeline and leaving Logan to be destined to outlive everyone he ever loved and become the last X Man left regardless how many times he and X-Men try to change the timeline. 
Logan and X-Men prevented Sentinels and erased original trilogy and the Wolverine timeline creating new timeline (X-Men First Class, DOFP, Apocalypse, Dark Phoenix, New Mutants, and Dead Pool films) where mutants are alive and become pop culture heroes similar to what MCU Avengers have become in their universe. 
Before you say Logan 2017 takes place in this new timeline and film is set five years after Days of Future Past I'm going by what was briefly discussed in the Making of Logan bonus feature with Hugh Jackman and James Mangold they intended for Logan to take place in a separate alternate timeline and when before film was released Mangold and Jackman did say it's set in an alternate timeline. 
Logan 2017 alternate timeline instead of Sentinels who wipe out all mutants its someone from Logan's past Rice who distributed a formula that was supposedly designed to repress the mutant gene through soft drinks and breakfast cereals but it ended up killing mutants en masse his plan was to eliminate the existing mutants so that he could start over and create his own mutants to be born, bred, and sold as weapons which leaves Logan as last survivor and final X Man. So no matter how many times Logan and X-Men are the pebble thrown into timeline (river) create a ripple but the current corrects itself no matter what they do the timeline will keep flowing the same direction extinction of mutant kind.",POSITIVE

"""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" is a slang term used to refer to a sexual act that involves three or more participants.

We've already seen the ultimate version of this movie. It's called Logan from 2017. I don't want to see Deadpool cosplaying as X-23. And a weak-sauce looking villain. Could have at least tried and give us Tilda Swinton in the role and not some girl who sounds like she's still in college.,NEGATIVE

You can drink beer at home you know, not watered, at reasonable price beer. It just feels weird. Also it is always one scene. We never see him at bar again.

"This will be the highlight of the year for sure. However (Spoilers)  I would say Xmen97 is directly leading up to this on Wolverines part, due to the convenient timing of the series that will finish not long before D&W is out, the cartoon costume, and the fact Pool has hinted at an act3 flashback which makes me think we won't need one because we will have allready saw it. Now with Bastion ensuring a war between humans and mutants, the build up for the new guy who clearly could go nuclear, effectively combining in leaving the world in a wasteland for the Victor's (mutants) antman potentially either tried taking on a giant sentinel or became a giant sentinel hence his corpse (Pretty sure pym was mentioned by beast). Magnetos goons all there potentially because they were secure in prison during the war etc. Basically I'm worried they will be wiping out the xmen97 crew :( leaving only wolverine who's mutation will likely stop him being transformed by Bastion ....",POSITIVE

Cassandra Nova is a red herring. The film's main villain is actually an alternate reality ancient one hence the doctor strange portal. You can also see where she blocks wolverine's claws at 2:01.

"Let me tell you what I think is going to happen remember Charls and Magneto went to logan asking for help and he said ""Get the f*ck out of here"" while sitting in a bar which led to the death of all of the X-man and maybe humans! (his World) ""Not him helping them"" This is that Logan so now we can see him sitting in a bar again where he's not welcome anymore and Deadpool comes to him. Thats why TVA accuse him of letting down his world because he didn't help them. So that's how this is his fault and now may be Deadpool convince him to help him not letting down other worlds and redeem himself this is why we can even see Deadpool fighting TVA to save him and guess what this is the reason we are hearing again and again in the trailer ""Get the F*ck out of here"".",NEGATIVE

"Yeah seeing Wolverine and Deadpool is awesome but, except for the cool use of the soundtrack, this trailer was terribly edited. They did a terrible job introducing Cassandra Nova, who is supposed to be Professor X's evil twin sister in an alternate universe so she's a very powerful, formidable supervillain. People need to remember that the hero is only as good as his villain.  I have no doubt this movie is going to be epic because of the cast and crew involved but  this trailer looked like it was edited by a kid from Fiverr.",NEGATIVE

"Everyone talking about how cool it is that we finally have wolverine with the yellow/blue suit but is nobody bothered by the fact(at least from the trailer) that he doesn't have the MASK??!!

Like imagine this scene at 1:31 with Hugh wearing the mask like dear god, that shot would've been like a childhood dream come true, I don't know what to feel about this trailer, Fox obviously avoided the mask as a publicity thing but why again?

- Motorcycle chariot? Seems like this production shares crew from Furiosa.

When wolverine leaned into the gun we know he wants to die 😢,NEGATIVE

Oh cool! Looks like they’re going to cherry pick from Old Man Logan again! Logan wasn’t a complete adaptation but clearly heavily influenced by an older beat down Wolverine who’s usually the last x man standing because of him in some way shape or form.

Can't wait to see Cassandra Nova live action.,POSITIVE
"As much as I am excited to see Hugh Jackman wear the claws again. A part of me sort've feels really bad for him. I know he was going through a rough separation with his wife when signing onto this and Logan was such a respectful send off for the character. Was Marvel that afraid to find somebody else to play Wolverine?? Then again, Indiana Jones 4 was a proper send off and they let Mangold direct the 5th movie (which is not bad btw). Seriously though, Studios need to stop recycling characters and actors for every big movie they release. Start bringing something new and refreshing. But regardless, Im always down to see Jackman play Wolverine.",POSITIVE
Too many f words,NEGATIVE
I'd appreciate it greatly if Disney kept their diverse and inclusive limp dribbling schlong out of the final cut of this movie. Here's to hoping that Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman got what they wanted.,NEGATIVE

"This is what we want, an independent stories that are not necessarily tied to some universe. Just like the comic books when we were kids, you could pick up whatever Spider man, X men, Wolverine/Hulk or what ever comic and it was just a story in time. You didn't have to already read all the other comics. You could just as easily make Iron Man movie that didn't have anything to do with the main universe like it has been since 2008 Iron Man 1. Give us the golden age again...",POSITIVE
The last part is the funniest,POSITIVE
THIS MOVUE VETTER BE GOOD OR IM SWITCHING TO DC I SWEAR TO GOD,NEGATIVE

The 20th Century Fox buried in the sand.  ROFL,NEGATIVE
Looks good. I hope everyone gives it a chance. For the last few years I no longer universally support Marvel but when something looks good I definitely want to send the message that you are going in a good direction. Equally not seeing a movie is a message that no I do not think this is a good direction. Sadly with a few exceptions Marvel has lossed the fans in an attempt to modernize things. But I did quite enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and this looks very impressive and a great time.,POSITIVE
"Idk, it's like that new Apes movie, it feels similar enough but kinda different and fake. I'm not that excited.",NEGATIVE

"""Hey, one of my kids is clearly emotionally disturbed. I know, I'll psychologically torment it out of him.""

Good god what a monster.",NEGATIVE
"Jeez, this kid deserves better, these “parents” are total evil freaks, his childhood is basically ruined, it's torture, and he is probably very traumatized by this all, I hope the children will be able to overcome this trauma and I wish them the best.",NEGATIVE
"Michael and Heather willingly put money and fame before their family, which is why they don't deserve one.",NEGATIVE
Peak,NEGATIVE
I'm willing to bet Cody's resting heart rate is through the roof.,POSITIVE

The CIA funded them,NEGATIVE
3:20 this didn’t end well for aubrey I can tell that,NEGATIVE
"I really hope cody and his sister were able to find some semblance of a normal, happy childhood with their mother. The amount of trauma and abuse they have to figure out at such a young age is completely unfair for a couple of innocent kids. I really hope nothing but the best for those kids",POSITIVE
35:55 Put on the sweater vest. You can’t be guilty if you’re dressed for Church.,POSITIVE
"I am so glad to see Phil get a special section in this because yes there was a lot of coverage going on, but Phil was a big part on these abusive assholes getting dragged into the spotlight. I honestly cannot believe Youtube still allows them to have a channel after all of this. Vtubers get slammed left and right for existing, but child abusers? Nah thats fine, its kids so its kid content.",NEGATIVE
Cody didn’t deserve it,NEGATIVE
"I come back to this video like every 2-3 months, i used to watch familyofive when i was like 12-13yrs old, im 21 now. And this video is so good, one of my all time favorite youtube videos❤",POSITIVE
"Everybody who consumed DaddyOFive content when it was being posted actively should be fucking ashamed of themselves.  It was always bad, it was always mean-spirited, and it was always hurtful toward the younger kids especially, and this shit amounts to nothing more than psychological and physical torture of children.  If you enjoy that content you are human garbage.",NEGATIVE
Guys this family were not bad stop:hating on daddy o5 all h did was pranks on his kids,POSITIVE
avtually insane editing well done,POSITIVE
Imagine this kids seeing his mother/father and siblings saying she doesn’t want him on a family trip and and that he had problem to millions of people—that would create an immense trauma to this kids as an adult!,NEGATIVE
"Vile and evil parents. This is hateful sick stuff.  I hope and pray every single one of those kids are taken away and get extensive therapy. And for the people who encouraged this, you’re just as evil and vile. 🤬🤬🤬 like this, is exactly what’s wrong with this world.",NEGATIVE
"Why tf did they even essentially kidnap Cody and Emma just to torture them?? I feel so awful for those kids, especially Cody. I hope they are doing okay now",NEGATIVE
"Pretty weird how narrator makes a point about Cory's parents abysing the child because of his mental disorders, but at the same time throwing around term narcissist as a synonym to ""moronic asshole""",NEGATIVE
"PLEASE follow this video up. the fact they swept this under the rug and are currently supporting the eldest son's ""rap"" career like nothing ever happened.",NEGATIVE
Me personally I fucking hate the dad because he reminds me exactly how my dad used to (and does) act maybe it’s cuz I have a bit of ptsd from my father but his attitude and personality gives me the shivers,NEGATIVE
Vile parents. They find fun in child cruelty. Absolutely sick.,NEGATIVE
I’d like to know Cody is okay,NEGATIVE
"The wicked step-mother from hell says that Cody “isn’t normal” and wishes he was a “normal child” of course he isn’t normal. The entire family aren’t normal. That’s going to rub off on the child. They treat him like literal dirt, he’s going to respond badly to that. All of that on top of his ODD too.",NEGATIVE
4:01 I thought Established Titles was a scam. 😮,NEGATIVE
"As someone who used to love family channels growing up, Daddyofive is nothing compared to most.",NEGATIVE
those title things are bullshit lol.,NEGATIVE
you should probably have put up a pinned comment about the sponsor scam that is Establish Titles by now. Just saying.,NEGATIVE
cody’s life no matter what is going to be full of internal struggles and that’s all bc his dad exploited him on the internet bc he thinks he’s a funny and creative guy. it’s gross and sad,NEGATIVE
"Kids pranks are supposed to be either between the kids, or something along the lines of “we’re going to the dentist” and driving to Disneyland. Making out that a negative thing is happening for a positive surprise to happen after. Kids pulling pranks on each other is a normal thing, but the adults acting this way is disgusting.",NEGATIVE
He looks like postal dude if he was a crackhead,NEGATIVE
fluff daddyo5 (not sayin f word i dont want my channel tooken down,NEGATIVE
"19:26 damn i really really really really relate to cody holy shit i might cry. holy shit. i have adhd so while i didn't have maybe as ""severe"" behavioral problems as cody i definitely had problem through my childhood-- i was overly literal, emotionally sensitive, easily distracted, a bit hyperactive and i struggled with sleeping, eating, and mood and i was also clumsy and like obviously when i was a kid i didn't have words for that. and so my parents would yell at me for bad performance and for whatever and just absolutely rip me apart and tell me i was lazy and doing everything on purpose and disgusting and worthless i would get so defensive and bothered and the argument would escalate. my younger sister, who is ""better"" than me would also get some abuse thrown at her but despite the fact that my DAD misusing his power and being ABUSIVE is the problem she's able to deescalate and so for it would just be this cycle which has eventually led to my SISTER who's also gotten the tail end of my dad's behavior despising ME because I've been deemed the ""problem"". also my dad LOVES to make fun of me & her and like do little pranks and bother us to see how we react and i have a lot less tolerance for this but when i ask him to stop (even politely) his anger takes full force and he just screams at me until i cry... i never really understood why my sister could think i was the problem even while she has faced my dad's abuse but this video is helping me understand it a bit better.",POSITIVE
"every year or so i rewatch videos about this horrendous channel, as disturbing as the content is, it's not something youtube should ever forget. Mike and Heather deserve the shame of their actions for the rest of their lives, and their predatory fans deserve to be reminded of the monstrosities they fueled. Cody should be an adult by now, from the bottom of my heart I hope he's okay. I doubt it, this kind of treatment will haunt someone for LIFE, but I really hope he's at least better now.",NEGATIVE
The fact they have a new YouTube channel and tiktok account blows my mind.,POSITIVE
Anyone know how Cody is doing currently?,NEGATIVE
20:37 We not gonna talk about how he just blocked that without even looking??,NEGATIVE
Why did the intro have to go so hard and all of the animation throughout this vid. WWWWWWW,NEGATIVE
Never been more uncomfortable and disgusted then while watching those clips of the abuse. It’s just so so upsetting.,NEGATIVE
What’s the outro song name?,POSITIVE
would you believe me if i told you they have a podcast now?,NEGATIVE
"All 3 parents needed at least the threat of jailtime. Rosanna lies like crazy around how she gave up her children willingly. Where's her attempts to get her son back? ""Snuck her daughter down"" to states away? I would call you a bad parent if you don't notice when your small child leaves the house, much less the state. What's crazy is the confidence she has in these easily disprovable lies. For instance, conflict of interest isn't possible at the consultation stage either, only during representation. I blame the interviewer for mentally taking sides here instead of remaining neutrally objective.",NEGATIVE
What the banger intro music in the beginning,POSITIVE
"33:54 ""the kid's ideas we act them out""  i cannot believe the absolute gall to push the blame onto the KIDS by saying the videos are all the kid's ideas...absolutely horrible people.",NEGATIVE
Ruby frankie is worse,NEGATIVE
"You're an idiot if you buy from Established Titles, its a scam.

1. They dont actually own any of this land, meaning they cant sell ownership to you.
2. The land you ""buy"" for 70ish dollars is actually smaller than the plaque it comes with.
3. By law, American citizens cannot claim noble titles such as Lord or Lady.",NEGATIVE
20:38 was one of the best blocks ive ever seen from a nine year old,POSITIVE
""" is just a prank... bro""? Some people DO NOT deserve children.",NEGATIVE
"I can't imagine not feeling safe in my own house. To be humiliated by your own father and filmed by your STEPmother is another level of abuse, that makes you mature waaaay too soon.",NEGATIVE
"I couldn’t even imagine being Cody, universally hated by not only your family, but the fans.",NEGATIVE
"She couldn't get a lawyer because none of them would represent her? Oh please what are these people billionaires with influence over their entire town or city? I feel for the mother as I do believe they were keeping the children to themselves primarily for the financial gain, but the mother herself - and her sister - are NOT telling the entire story",NEGATIVE
What uncreative people who have to abuse their kids for clout,NEGATIVE
"The whole line of: ""I love him to death"" doesn't really stick after not only his siblings but also his parents abuse him. Its surprise they aren't behind bars is a mystery I'll never understand.",NEGATIVE
"I hadn’t heard of them before.  That poor child, children but particularly Cody.  I hope he is ok",NEGATIVE
This prankster dad must go to jail he abuse his kids but I have a feeling they have to say he not abuse and that a lie I bet the kids are scared and bet they can’t call the police I do feel bad for the kids who hates pranks,NEGATIVE
These children will all grow up to be abusive to their children. And their children will abuse their children. And so on.,NEGATIVE
"What ever happened to prank channels? They used to be practical jokes and other stuff like that, but now it’s like threw my son down a flight of stairs for a prank and they act like the kids are the bad ones and wonder why their kids and the Internet hates them",NEGATIVE
OMG THESE PEOPLE ARE PURE EVIL!!!😢,NEGATIVE
"Those parents are deranged and pure evil. Even though this was a long time ago, I feel bad for all of those kids especially Cody 😢😢",NEGATIVE
"There was a YouTube channel called DaddyOFive Truth where they were putting out that the ink “prank” was acting and that Rose was the real abuser and then people are defending Mike and Heather, I wasn’t sure if it was legit or it was lies because they probably supported Mike and Heather when the account was still active and they most likely tricked people into thinking the complete opposite.",NEGATIVE
This guy's voice is so majestic and the editing is just 😍,POSITIVE
Why are you taling slow,NEGATIVE
I remember watching them ALOT when I was 7 yrs old and laughing at their videos and just seeing all the tears and crying as laughter or something funny. Now that Im older I truly realize how disgusting and messed up the parents were to their kids to messed up..,POSITIVE
"Poor sweet little Cody. God how terrible to treat a child, their own child, like that. I hope he heals. God I wanna give him a hug. I have 2 little boys and I could never treat them like that.",NEGATIVE
"This DaddyOFive Channel Is Not Family Friendly Because The Family Is Broken And They're Not Friendly, UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN!",NEGATIVE
Is anyone going to talk about how creepy that thumbnail looks 💀,NEGATIVE
14:34 Mike yelled at Ryan on PUT IT DOWN 😢I felt really bad for Cody and Emma because they have been abused by daddyofive,NEGATIVE
i love daddyofive,POSITIVE
DaddyOFive’s voice sounds like Logan Thirtyacre from SML. Are they related?,NEGATIVE
I hate every single one of the people in the comments that said hit Cody on the side of the head and abuse him at 16:20 ahd at 16:39,NEGATIVE
I honestly didn’t see this as abuse until I watched this video. Idk my dad did some of the same stuff minus the youtube channel and camera in the mix.,NEGATIVE
"I haven't seen any of there videos but I have to be missing something,putting the writing sentences and physical abuse together is strange.Is writing sentences abuse now?I had a step mom that would make me paint rocks.I didn't feel abused.I had a step dad that would beat the shit out of me when he had a bad day at work.painting rocks seemed like a reasonable punishment.I don't let my kids play xbox tell there chores/homework is done is that abuse?To be clear I'm not saying there's no abuse here there definitely monsters I just feel like I must be missing something",NEGATIVE
"That thumbnail looks creepy 
Looks something out of a smilex commercial from batman",NEGATIVE
This fucking sickens me! As a dad with an almost 3 year old. Abuse and Pranks are two different things and this guy was for sure not doing pranks… I hope these kids find peace.,NEGATIVE
"who the fuck actively wants a child to be punished? prank youtubers are horrible, but the fans of the prank youtubers are a whole other issue",NEGATIVE
FUCK THIS DAD,NEGATIVE

"When a monster drinking, wall punching “Kyle” turns into a dad.",POSITIVE
5 years is not enough and not a fair sentence for Mike and Heather. They should have gotten longer and jail time. They should have punished them properly. They abused and neglected their children.,NEGATIVE
"I can't watch the whole video. It makes me so angry, and my blood boils. I hope Mike and Heather get a really long time in jail. I hope all the kids are with someone else ( biological mother, maybe) who can love and look after them unconditionally and not go back to Heather and Mike. I hope Mike and Heather lost custody and never see their kids ever again. They are really horrible, disgusting, and vile human beings. They are not parents.",NEGATIVE
"Anybody know the song that plays in the beginning intro? The link to the tracks in the desc (Which I believe are music tracks) are 404'd all to hell, so if anybody could tell me that'd be phenomenal.

(Edit: Just found its original variant; its called Peanut Butter Conspiracy by It's Alright, but I still want to find the variant used in the video. If anyone has any success, they can post it here).",NEGATIVE
I always hate how people use “it’s just a prank” as a way to justify their terrible actions. 😡,NEGATIVE
"The first part of this video was bad enough, these people are horrid. I figured it couldn't get much worse until we learned those kids were taken from their mother against their will and allegedly with forged documents. The legal system in those states absolutely failed these children. It's shameful.",NEGATIVE
"I wish I could give little Cody a hug. Poor sweet boy. Relentlessly gaslit and abused by two people that were supposed to be his biggest fans. It makes my blood absolutely boil seeing these clips, hopefully he’s doing ok now.",NEGATIVE
attacking Joey Salads with bricks is the correct response to him letting you have them,NEGATIVE
The one part where they are kicking cody out of the house just breaks my heart. He probably has no clue they are joking with him and if I where in that situation at his age i would be terrified so i cant imagine what he was feeling,NEGATIVE
Holy shit that cringy!,NEGATIVE
"These parents are broadcasting child abuse. Love your videos and how you present them, I can't keep watching it though. I really hope these children got some professional help when they could finally escape these horrid people.",NEGATIVE
They rlly came back to tiktok and everyone is comenting like ur the goat like what vru,NEGATIVE

Can’t wait for your ruby frankie video,POSITIVE
"Nerd city did this video years ago bud try harder bozo 
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡",NEGATIVE
I don’t know Cody or his medical history but I have severe doubts that he has ODD. It just seems like a child reacting to being psychologically tortured by his own parents. Obviously he is oppositional and defiant.,NEGATIVE
We owe Buck Cluck an apology.,NEGATIVE
Prank videos were a dark part of modern human history.,NEGATIVE

"I stg these parents are so infuriating. I grew up and am *still* growing up with a manipulative narcissist for a parent and only recently realized that I *am* traumatized by him and I'm not just overreacting. Feels good to know that I'm not just being a baby. Also, the intro was fire 👍",POSITIVE

These people should be in prison for life…if not worse.,NEGATIVE
"What is really concerning is that the oldest that pops into cameras to say ""its just a prank bro"" and also is the one who talks really shitty about cody when they pretend to send cody away is on the path to become just like the dad... Someone should really keep an eye on him...",NEGATIVE
"This is so messed up to do to your kids. And to record it for people to see.. it's just.. so messed up. Poor Cody, the poor kids.",NEGATIVE
"I was bullied in school and also of by my family as well (black sheep) and I feel for little man Cody. I hope he got away from these f*cking people and never has to meet them again.
Also, the more Martin's face came onto the screen, the more punchable he became.",NEGATIVE
"The emotional damage that those kids suffered, especially little Cody, will never, ever go away. 
He will never trust anyone. 
He will never even trust himself. 
He will always suffer from poor self esteem and self worth. 
I cannot imagine how awful it would be to grow up with ‘parents’ so truly repugnant and ignorant.",NEGATIVE

Remember when keemstar defended him,POSITIVE
"You know when you're out somewhere, and on occasion you hear a parent yelling at their child and calling them this and that from close by, and your blond runs cold because you can tell by the parent's voice that they're still managing to hold themselves back only because they're around other people? And you catch a glance at the kid and they have that look of defeat on their face, like this is something that happens every day, but you're powerless to do anything because you're a passing stranger and you can't prove the parent's doing anything more than raising their voice and maybe just being stressed. But something in you just knows that's not the case. 

That's what scares me about these channels, because it's not a heat of the moment thing, it's all recorded, watched through and edited and they STILL act like this. I don't want to imagine what was happening off camera.",NEGATIVE
"Ruby Franke and Jodi Hildebrandt just took the title of this video... i think they saw this channel as a challenge. and said hold my beer...

Cody is literally so adorable why his monster of a father chose this type of utter bs,NEGATIVE
Yeah I couldn't make it even halfway through this video I was getting to upset,NEGATIVE
Cody getting blamed for the ink reminds me of bush blaming Iraq for 9/11. Cody getting blamed for the dog poo in the bathroom reminds me of W bush blaming Iraq for killing babies in Kuwaiti hospitals. Poor Cody getting treated like Iraq,NEGATIVE
he doesn't deserve kids,NEGATIVE
I had foster parents from hell my uncle and aunt,NEGATIVE
The way how this man had edited this intro is fucking amazing the way how he edited it made me feel all of the feelings he intended,POSITIVE

I doubt you'll ever see this comment but if you do please know most of the world doesn't condone what was done to you and your siblings.  It wasnt jokes it wasnt funny and to any normal person we are outraged it took so long to get yall to safety.  ❤❤",POSITIVE

"I can't finish this. Regardless of my own experience with being abused by my parents, these two sadistic monsters should be put in jail for 25 years.",NEGATIVE
"Is it just me or did the parents mostly mess with Cody and Emma because of how they looked? I remember a video when the older boys called Emma a ""ginger"" in a very disgusting way. It's no coincidence that the 2 redheads in the family were picked on the most. I have heard discrimination against red hair is common, so I was just wondering if this is the case.",NEGATIVE
"What boggles me is that the dad and stepwhore- i mean stepmom don't look at the videos, see the way the kids react, and wonder why they're being persecuted",NEGATIVE
"HTF does a whole family bully, abuse and emotionally torture one child in particular - and the viewers think this is fantastic fun!?!!? This is a CHILD being subjected to gross psychological abuse by PARENTS (who have included the other children). You are sick if you think this is okay!",NEGATIVE
His talking about authenticity yet he promotes established titles which if you guys didn’t know it’s a scam,NEGATIVE
Omg this is fucking awful. The ink thing is just..beyond any kind of “prank” I’ve ever seen.,NEGATIVE
"It's like they were trying to raise a serial killer, constantly pushing Cody to his breaking point.",NEGATIVE
"If you comment on their new channel, calling them out for what they did, their fans will come down on you like a natural disaster. It’s downright pathetic people still defend them. They seriously believe they didn’t do anything wrong even the parents themselves believe that too the description of the channel says “my parents were wrongfully accused” disappointing. Also, they hide comments that are critical of them. They even block people I should know because they did that to me…",NEGATIVE
It's hella sad when a grown man has to pick on an 8 year old. That's his equal. That's who he has to fight in order for it to be fair. Glad they took these kids away.,NEGATIVE
The thumbnail looks like something out of the smile tapes,NEGATIVE
All of that yelling had to have caused constant anxiety. I would utterly lose my mind. Money and clout isn't worth any of that permanent damage they caused those poor kids.,NEGATIVE

This kid needs a warm hug I feel bad for all those kids,POSITIVE
"say, what would yall do if u were one of the parents and they landed in the ""custody"" of these monsters disguised as caretakers to their innocent kids?",NEGATIVE
I really don’t get how people ever thought that channel was funny.,NEGATIVE
How is he not arrested yet he abused and practically stole his own children and broadcast their torture to millions,NEGATIVE
Wow. This family... YouTube allows this show yet makes adults say unalived? Does anyone think exposing their kids to a life on camera is a good idea anymore? To think these parents treated their kids this way in front of the camera is soul crushing. How are we ever going to evolve as a species?,NEGATIVE
Oh my! The irony of this video having established titles as a sponsor!,NEGATIVE
I pray that poor kid gets away from those sick bastards.,NEGATIVE

"""pranks"" are only funny to the one creating them, not the recipient",NEGATIVE
The redhead kid is so charismatic... No pranks were needed with him in the shot,POSITIVE
I just can’t imagine ANYONE watching this and finding it FUNNY.  Those that watch and click are SICK.,NEGATIVE
Good video tarnished by a sponsor who has been exposed as a scam.,NEGATIVE

"I hope cody is doing amazing now, he should be turning 17 or turned this year.",POSITIVE
Well... They ain't the worst anymore...,NEGATIVE
Anybody who uses there own kids for views are sick bastards.,NEGATIVE
"Listen, as a mid-teenager, I think that kids, myself included, can be brats a lot of the time. But when I heard Cody’s story… I just wanted to give that boy the BIGGEST and warmest hug he’s ever had, because no child should have to experience a FRACTION of what Cody went through. Like I can only begin to imagine the torment and drama that went on in that house and to Cody especially. And seeing how he’s the most mature in there, just shows that this kid has aged 30 years despite looking like he’s 8. Poor kid. I wish the best of luck to Cody in his life and I hope his parents learn a valuable lesson: That kids remember everything. What you do to them when they’re young will stick with them forever. Thank you for reading this far. Means a lot.❤❤❤",POSITIVE
Omfg,NEGATIVE
I love how a channel that's supposed to be all about researching scams is advertising a scam.,NEGATIVE
Mike peaked in high school and Heather seems to genuinely hate Cody.,NEGATIVE

Cody will probably become a narc himself. Just hideous the whole thing....,NEGATIVE
First off people are f'd up for watching them giving them the views period. Majority of these people have kids and u think this shit is funny? And why wasn't CPS called,NEGATIVE
*What disgusts me is that these parents don’t care about their children they care about themselves😡*,NEGATIVE
The worse parents and they are not funny,NEGATIVE
Minus the “pranks” I was Cody in my family. Everything was my fault. My whole family said I was a bother and that is why I cut contact with them.,NEGATIVE
are we not gonna talk about how goddamn clean that intro was,POSITIVE
I knew about this family channel when it was all coming out about the abuse but I had no idea that the AUDIENCE was also demanding abuse for Cody. Fucking disgusting.,NEGATIVE
Comments like that hit Cody on the side of the head people like that should be able to be charged for attempting to harm a child some people take shit to far and do what people say on their comments and end up killing people smh people are sick so sorry for that poor kid,NEGATIVE
Even this summary/documentation hurts to watch. Feel sorry for the kids,NEGATIVE
These videos are funny....how?,NEGATIVE
I know this is from a year ago and it is a good video about an important topic (from a Youtuber I like). But it's pretty funny seeing a channel talking about moral behaviour on Youtube while selling fake titles and mystery land in Scotland as a sponsor. lol,NEGATIVE
That's disgusting why aren't these ppl in jail,NEGATIVE
"This is where the phrase ""All children deserve parents, but not all parents deserve children."" Comes into play here. Even if these so-called ""Harmless pranks"" were just pranks made for content, would people really believe that? Well, no. No they won't.

This channel is an example of just that, but it also shows that people would do anything to become famous, even if it meant putting others in harms way. These people shouldn't have went with the prank genre for content but they did so and made Cody's life a living nightmare because of it for getting him involved with their pranks.",NEGATIVE
Thanks for helping us with our trees in scotland,POSITIVE
“ what are Clorox wipes?! “ - heart breaking,NEGATIVE
what a POS. I hope those kids are okay now,NEGATIVE
You talk toooo much,NEGATIVE
Bad parents and hundreds of thousands of terrible surrporters. Our world is f-ed if this is what passes as entertainment.,NEGATIVE
"Why would a parent fuck up their own child, not to mention proudly filming it and showing off to the publice",NEGATIVE
"Look, I’m all for goofy harmless pranks like most of the stuff RossCreations does nowadays that just kinda mess with people mentally but the fact that they were abusing their kids and got away with it is so wild to me",NEGATIVE
After quite a few of these type of channels get caught out outright abusing their children I'm absolutely amazed this kind of content is even allowed on any platform. It's like people hate children,NEGATIVE
This is where the fall of our civilization happens. Idiocracy at it's finest.,POSITIVE
especially the ‘poop series’ and the emotional meltdowns.. which will now be some where on the internet forever. I can’t even imagine how humiliating that is for them (especially Cody) and they’ll probably be mocked by their peers forever.,NEGATIVE
Those parents belong in prison for child abuse,NEGATIVE
I’m so glad they are back with their mother,POSITIVE
Parents like that make me think that there should be like a test to see if they would even be a decent parent,NEGATIVE
Holy shit man. I really think there shouldn’t family channels on YouTube. I think it’s disgusting and abusive. No parent should be allowed to exploit a child just for money.,NEGATIVE
Oh god no. Not the most abusive of punishments. Writing lines.,POSITIVE
"I hope the kids don't get lack of confidence to do anything in life from jobs and love and get as far away from their "" parents "" and use them an example of what not to be. 
And I wish the parents can be held accountable and banned from social media.",NEGATIVE
Cody should've moved out of daddyofive's household,NEGATIVE
"A note on Oppositional Defiant Disorder: a lot of psychologists have issues with its definition and inclusion in the DSM. The reason for this is that it’s basically just “disagreeing with authority disorder” and in many circumstances, it is perfectly understandable for people to develop a resistance to authority figures. Children with developmental disorders such as ADHD or autism often struggle to understand rules and social norms, and tend to either become unusually compliant or unusually resistant to authority figures who try to enforce social norms for the child. Children with abusive parents also have a good reason to distrust and act against authority figures— they don’t have any examples of people who don’t use their power to cause harm. For pretty much any person diagnosed with ODD, there’s usually a very clear reason why they defy people with power in their lives, and those reasons go completely ignored. In Cody’s case, it’s no surprise at all that he acted against adults and got into fights often.",POSITIVE
I hate heaters 3 sons as much as I hate the 2 parents,NEGATIVE
I hope he is okay now and can feel my hugs. I feel so bad for him.,NEGATIVE
"When Cody says, ""That's messed up"" speaks volumes about these arseholes. They should do jail time.
De Franco didn't cause any trouble.  He probably stopped a murder. These animals have no limits ~ ""It's a prank!!!"" 😈
It bothers me that people watch this crap.",NEGATIVE
cody said he doesn’t know what trauma is,NEGATIVE
"Somehow I was unaware of this channel until now.  This is heartbreaking.  Treating your child like sh*t is awful.  Couching mistreatment as “just a prank” is beyond messed up and must be so damaging.  How do you trust your own sense of reality when you’re constantly being mistreated and abused for the entertainment of others only to be told you’re overreacting and it’s “just a prank?”  Gaslighting at its finest.  If Cody didn’t have issues prior to this treatment, he no doubt would have after.",NEGATIVE
Dear god.  That poor kid.,NEGATIVE
You think this is bad? You should see 8 passengers.,NEGATIVE
Daddyofive is so evil,NEGATIVE

Anybody knows the intro song?,NEGATIVE
"DaddyOfive is a Dysfunctional Youtuber 

I feel sad for his kids cody & Emma they don't deserve to be abused 

Mike & Heather are dumb like the Joker & Harley Quinn  how they brain washed Timmothy Drake ( Robin ) from Batman beyond return of the Joker.",NEGATIVE
"""this was our kids ideas  we would play them out""
IS THAT HOW YOU INTERPRET AN IDEA A KID MADE??? PHYSICALLY ABUSING YOUR CHILDREN WAS THEIR IDEA???  
I CALL THE BIGGEST SLICE OF CAP EVER CONCIEVED",NEGATIVE
Im really glad that this shitstick lost custody of Cody and Emma. What sadist do you have to be to torment your kids for people on the internet,NEGATIVE
They need to stop monetizing kids.  There is no reason that they should be on display like this.,NEGATIVE
Micheal behind kid behind a camera is an absolute degenerate train wreck and is easily as bad as these people. a video on him and the family drama they have going on particularly that with his brother charlie would be quite a view,NEGATIVE
"Rewatching the ink prank actually triggered me a bit. Heard my parents argue a bit and when it got ugly, they yelled like Mike and Heather",NEGATIVE
Holy shit! Cody’s reactions to the pranks just tug at my heartstrings in one of the worst ways!,POSITIVE
"this is awful..a pathetic, coward of a ""man"" monetizing child abuse?!? who's laughing at this?  and this woman is disgusting",NEGATIVE
cody truly deserves so much better than this and i hope he’s getting that. seeing his reactions and how they treated him breaks my heart i can’t even finish the video,NEGATIVE
"When I got spelling words and math problems wrong, my dad had me write it 100 times. I was mad then but thank him now. That isn't abuse",POSITIVE
"While I agree Cody and daddy o 5 is horrific, you seem to be defending the Mum a lot. There are certainly a bunch of red flags around her as well.",NEGATIVE
"God: don’t verbally abuse someone or show hatred to someone
Me: but it’s Daddyofive
God: now I can make an exception my friend.",NEGATIVE
the are horrible but i wouldnt say they are the worst i think that goes to ruby franke,NEGATIVE
Cody is correct! They are creating serious mental health issues...,NEGATIVE
What an awful father!...,NEGATIVE
I wonder why he looks a lot like the postal dude?,NEGATIVE
why does the stepmom slip into a blaccent when she says how she doesn't want to take cody to disneyland???,NEGATIVE
"The clip where Mike literally screams at his child when he learns that he self harmed at school genuinely made me sick. If you’re a parent and you learn that your child is self harming, no matter how scary or shocking it might be for you never EVER yell at them, never raise your voice, never make them feel like they’re being punished for having mental struggles. GET. THEM. HELP.",NEGATIVE
"Best channel, with the worst sponsors. Not daddyofive, I mean you.",NEGATIVE
what is the name of the song at the beginning,POSITIVE
isn't this just scapegoating? either way seeing his reactions and hearing the way his family talks about him is heartbreaking no kid deserves that.,NEGATIVE
this feels so dystopian,NEGATIVE
"The thing that gives the abuse away is that whenever anything bad happens, Cody automatically assumes it’s his fault, even when he didn’t do anything.  I hope he’s doing better now

Edit: another thing is that pranks can be funny but there’s a limit, especially when children are involved.  They don’t always understand reality and what may seem like a mindless prank to an adult could scar a kid.",NEGATIVE

this makes my soul so sad. I hope these kids get the help that they need to be ok.,POSITIVE
"Like I swear the parents are like ""Every day is a serious april fools prank)",NEGATIVE
"I just wanna give Cody a hug man. I had similar parents without the cameras and pranks. They never took the time to understand my ADHD + depression and my brothers ADHD + ODD + BPD. 

They put us through at home obedience training like we were dogs one summer for around 2 weeks straight. I don't even remember what we were being punished for. 

They took things like taking a second to start a new task which is common in adhd as a direct insult and incompliance. We didn't have any privacy and they even threatened to block my best friend off of everything because i was ""texting him too much"" (they found out that i mainly vented to him about my home life). 

Anything you remotely cared about was up for grabs as a random over the top punishment to be held over your head. Didn't start dishes within an hour of being asked? Oops, guess you're grounded from reading for a month

They'd yell at me for looking sad when they knew i had depression and i have rbf in general. One time they even tried to kick me out at 16 because ""If you're so miserable here and you hate your family so much, your ass can live in the street"" and got mad after i started packing after they told me to.

Sorry for the rant. I could literally make a podcast about everything. I'm still feeling effects from it into adulthood and i know how hard it is to try to fix yourself when your whole life so far has been a dumpster fire. I just recently got comfortable sitting by myself in my living room. I hope Cody is living a better life now",NEGATIVE
Your sponsor is a scam.,NEGATIVE
Thats DISGUSTING  they was Psychologically  Abusing  their children as well as Physically  as a Girl who was VICTIMISED by her own Mum & her Alcoholic  Bf .  They should be  In Jail for All  that Trauma they've Inflicted  on their  Innocent  children.  Bless them i hope  Emma & cody are healing & get All the ❤ they Need & Deserve  too.,NEGATIVE
This was confirmed to be acting you need to do more research,NEGATIVE
I still don’t consider this abuse and will never consider this abuse if you watch there videos very carefully you will notice moments where the kids are trying hard not to laugh at there “angry abusive parents”  the kids also came out about it years later  grown up saying what happened behind the scenes and showed behind the scenes footage of them redoing scenes and stuff I also thought I heard Emma and Cody didn’t want to leave and why would they leave there real mother in the first place huh? Everyone thinks they’re in a safe place but there’s a reason they left her and they’re probably doing terrible now just because of all of you idiots and morons who make videos like these. Stop living in the past plz and just grow up that family has been through enough and actually have changed the way the JOKE to there kids,NEGATIVE
"Not only did this pos torture his children, he corrupted three other children to take part and think that this is an acceptable way to treat someone who is vulnerable and clearly abused.",NEGATIVE

It’s no coincidence that the two kids that got it the worst with these so-called “pranks” were the two that were NOT heather’s bio kids. 😒. What a narcissistic, jealous, hate-filled woman. It’s awful that the courts just ignored Rose and those children until it all blew up in the media. I cannot even fathom the pain Rose went through as a mother watching her children be abused on YouTube, all for the court to decide that it wasn’t abuse 🤦🏼‍♀️. Thank GOD someone finally woke up and got those kids out of there. I can only imagine the hours upon hours and YEARS of counseling it’ll take to undo what those two did to those poor babies. They got off WAY too easy. And these diehard, loyal fans of theirs are sick sadists who like watching children suffer. 🤨",NEGATIVE

Well he punished me for that.",NEGATIVE

Focusing their torture on one child, the most vulnerable as the youngest and his ODD.  With that diagnosis, I can't comprehend that these people broadcast their abuse to the world and nothing was done about it.

Maryland? Corporal punishment?

The way they went after Cody is sick.  Cockroaches don't deserve to be compared to them.",NEGATIVE

I dont call this a prank!! Its total abuse this is insane! 😢 so many things are wrong! On so many levels! I hope they are stopped!🤯😭,NEGATIVE
"I'm rewatching this, and I can only imagine how these kids felt, especially Cody and Emma. I'm an older sibling myself and the eldest of all my siblings. For a good 11 years, it was just myself and the eldest of my younger brothers, him only being a few years younger than me, and when we were both little, I did the best I could to help my parents look after not only myself but my brother. I would, then and now, do anything for that boy, and that extends to my other two siblings and even my former step sister.
Emma is only two years younger than me, so while I can understand how she must have felt regarding the treatment of her little brother, but I can only the imagine the trauma she went through and deals with when it comes to how she was treated, how Cody was treatment, and even possible guilt that she may have felt or still feels that she couldn't do anything. 
I hope body she and Cody are doing well in the current year and have been able to deal with their trauma healthily.",POSITIVE

As a parent... and a human... it hurts me to the core to see poor cody suffer. Jesus christ. Wtf is wrong with these absolute disgusting wastes of space excuses for 'parents' 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,NEGATIVE
"my heart hurts for poor Cody. He seems like such a sweet and mature child. Behavioral issues don’t make a child undesirable. If those useless parents spent half as much time getting Cody some help and treating him better than they did making pranks, he would be much happier.",NEGATIVE

sorry, thats just fucking cruel
Glad the daddyofive channel was termed. Good god",NEGATIVE
"Honestly, I like your content but I can't watch this anymore. These people are freaking horrible. To treat your own kids like that regardless of their behaviors or actions is outright cruel. You're not loving and nurturing your son at this point. I feel bad for this generation. There is a BIG difference between pranks and abuse. This is abuse. I know I'm a sensitive individual but as someone who also had issues as a kid and dealt with them and now became a decent human, I hate to see a child in this situation and I'm glad the kids were taken from these parents. They use their kids as pawns in the main scheme, all for money. That money isn't going to last forever, but the amount of trauma these kids have been dealt will. This is BS.",NEGATIVE
I'VE NEVER MET A MIKE I LIKE....NEVER!,NEGATIVE
The best intro I've ever seen,POSITIVE

"This is such a good video, such a well-made and hella entertaining video that I've come back to watch it again just as I'd watch a video I'd never watched before. Granted, the last time I watched this was about a year ago, I just have so much respect for this creator and this video, anyway, I will get back to watching this gold.

I'm here again. This video is gold. I'll return one day.",POSITIVE
these poor kids. the deep rooted trust issues these children probably have is heartbreaking.,NEGATIVE
If these were my parents I would call the police for child abuse and the worse and most develist pranks ever,NEGATIVE
What’s even more ironic is that your sponsor “ESTABLISHED TITLES” is a complete scam that’s been proven by many people like Coffeezilla and others..everyone on here seems to be a shill for advertisement money,NEGATIVE
"34:53 should probably learn how to spell ""lose"" when talking about taking kids away.

The shit they did to rose is some real nefarious shit. Not to even mention those poor kids.,NEGATIVE

Child abuse .,NEGATIVE
"You tube is great for many reasons im not against it at all and its got loads of amazing content, but it has spawned some disturbing trends. Not just fake pranks and families. I despise the fake animal rescues,fake adoptions,
manipulated scenario's for views and likes. Even those virtue signalling giving the homeless money etc. Although im sure people are grateful for the gifts given and positive impact its still just a scam for views as opposed to a genuine desire to help someone in need. Its exploitation in all its forms.",NEGATIVE
Dude you’re making great content but I’m worried about your mental health. You’ve been staring into the abyss for a long time …,NEGATIVE
"No offense, but writing ""I will not argue"" 25 times is a decent punishment (lines). I'm going to edit this comment once I finish the video.",NEGATIVE
I think I'm more disturbed by the people who watch this content.,NEGATIVE
"I watched a few videos and it made me sick to my stomach. I'm so glad he got called out. As bad as Mike was, Heather was even worse to Emma and Cody because they weren't hers; they're literally red-headed stepchildren.",NEGATIVE
"The ""If you loved me, you wouldn't leave me,"" and the ""That's messed up,"" shows just how much they've miss treated Cody. I honest to God hope that Cody is OK, with a better family and with an amazing support system.",NEGATIVE
Poor Cody,NEGATIVE
I can’t get through it. I can’t.,NEGATIVE
I feel so much fucking worse after his. This is the WORST man ever. And the mother is even worse. Not parents. I am sick.,NEGATIVE

"Established titles is just a scam and shouldn't be promoted to your audience. I appreciate your content, but creators should do their due diligence when taking sponsorships...",NEGATIVE
What complete and utter pieces of sht. How in the world did CPS decide that it would be perfectly fine to leave three out of the five kids in the custody of these disgusting subhumans?,NEGATIVE
im crying,NEGATIVE

"As someone who's gone through emotional and mental abuse, this isn't okay at all.

It's just not.",NEGATIVE
"My parents did similar to me back in the 70s. I was the ""weird"" one. It f'd with my head for along time. Then I realized they were the weird ones for picking on their own child. But, at least it wasn't filmed. I hope Cody's doing ok.",NEGATIVE
Who does this to his kids... sick... pick on someone your own age/size... this is just sick.,NEGATIVE
I know the video covers a sad topic but the intro did not had to go that hard,POSITIVE
Can I just say how much i love your youtube channel and the editing skills amazing bro keep it up,POSITIVE
"The fact I watched them when I was a lot younger and I knew that the parents were bad even myself as like a 10 year old kid knew that I wouldn’t let those pranks go too far and I wouldn’t like it either, yeah there were some funny ones but they went too far and I really felt bad for the kid",NEGATIVE

"This ""Family"" is disturbing. I don't want to even research them, giving them more views.",NEGATIVE
"The bastard running that channel really gives the *yells ""it's just a prank bro"" as he bleeds out on the pavement* vibe.",NEGATIVE
"I won’t watch the video I’m sorry. I can’t watch that sort of thing. I can watch graphic combat videos, and surgery videos. I hunt and fish. That means gutting and cleaning game. I can handle just about anything, but the absolute moral failing of those two individuals is sickening beyond comprehension. That sort of sickness feeds from itself. Those two egged one another on to do horrific harm to their child and somehow manage to sleep at night. I hope he sues them for every penny gained from his abuse.",NEGATIVE
Thank god for that youtubers humanity persisting holy hell that is so disturbing that people enjoyed that and fought for it to stay and sent him death threats trying to silence it. not to mention the car thing is insane.. im convinced there are many more like these parents now 😭 those poor kids.,POSITIVE

How old is Cody? I wish to adopt him and allow him to be in my family so he can get the help he needs and treat him with the love he needs.,POSITIVE

"I thought the sponsor was an ad for Scott Land ,🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿",NEGATIVE
People like mike and heather are the reasons why people should take a test to see if they are mental enough yo have kids or parent them.... I remember his channel was big back in yhe day and well all i can say was he and is wife are fucked up people and need to get help,NEGATIVE
"Dear Lord these two people have no shame. No heart no mercy no decency.
They behave like savages.",NEGATIVE
I almost wonder if Cody had ODD “naturally”…or if it was developed due to the abuse and neglect from his parents.,NEGATIVE
"These parents are seriously in a lack of better words, shitty. Cody didn't deserve all the hate he got in the fan base, his reactions are very reasonable from a boy of such a young age, especially when his parent pulled all those pranks on him. I am so glad that Cody and Emma are with their biological mother. The parents really are monsters to do this to their own kids at the time, I hope the Martin Family channel won't be as problematic. (I screamed when Mike said it was all fake, honestly I think it was just an excuse to save face for both him and his wife. That's just how I feel) (Sorry if what I stated is false (?) )",NEGATIVE
3:40 wow scam attack,NEGATIVE
jesus fucking christ this was so insane to watch 😭 i hope that child gets to heal,POSITIVE

"Poor Cody, his parents were fcking monsters",NEGATIVE
I hope Cody and Emma were put into foster care or something. I'd gladly raise them myself if it meant they could have a better life than with their psycho parents. They legitimately seem like good kids.,NEGATIVE
"Imagine pranking your own kids to the point they have a mental break down.

You really gotta be a real monster to do such a thing to a child.

All for views I can't even.

Evil.",NEGATIVE
This family is actually fucked up,NEGATIVE
This disgusts me never ever do stuff like this as a parent,NEGATIVE
These parents are absolutely evil and f***ed up in the head. I hope their kids are being treated better and have a better life than these demons!,NEGATIVE
Concerning he had so many followers. People that liked watching child abuse 😮,NEGATIVE
I’d never seen or heard of this family before. Where is the biological mother? Gosh he hates that child.,NEGATIVE
"The fact that Cody didn’t cry much in the other videos shown, but cried hysterically when they blamed him for “ruining the carpet again”, makes me wonder if he was more seriously punished the first time he “ruined” their carpet and had to have it replaced. He seemed actually terrified, that makes me wonder what they did to these children behind doors.",NEGATIVE
My brother has ODD and you have to be understanding and patient but these parents don't show that which causes more behavioral problems.,NEGATIVE
the thumbnail give me nightmares,NEGATIVE
"I hope your two kids can sue them for a bunch of that money, a lot is owed as Cody was in a ton and making the parents living off of it, that’s child exploitation, the parents are expected to care for them, roof, food, etc but they literally turned him into a slave!  Think I heard there’s been some laws passed that would allow them already, not sure which states!! The”  crazy mom and dad”should’ve been charged with forging documents, that maybe mail fraud!",NEGATIVE
Sick intro,NEGATIVE

That sweet baby Cody deserves the world I would give my life for him.,POSITIVE
Those parents dont deserve kids.,NEGATIVE
"Any prank involving kids can't have ""you are in massive cuss-out trouble"" or ""you are unloved, get out"" as part of it. (God, especially when the kid was already taken from his mom?!) ....Imma tell you too, couldn't be my kids. They'd have been calling the cops to come out them in protective custody, if it'd been my son screamed at and crying like that. Hunnnneee.",NEGATIVE
"I like how they make fun of him for being supposedly sensitive when it's very clear that he likely has OCD, infect the owner of this video even claimed it himself. It's crazy how far people will go just for a couple of money, daddyofive I will admit was kind of never funny and the fact that he's saying that the haters did not see the humor in the invisible ink one is just so stupid and bad.",NEGATIVE
you knows whats also fked up channels like you get money for exploiting this content no dig at you personally but why the hell do u get money and sponsors for sharing terrifying stories of abuse ?????????????? bet you got channel merch too,NEGATIVE
"I remember getting recommended a video of theirs a long ass time ago, and going like “something is wrong about this dude and what he’s doing” and never watched him again. It helped I didn’t really like “prank” or “making my brother rage” videos (outside of that classic one), so when the controversies popped up, I honestly went “huh. Not surprised.”

Anyone who abuses their child and doesn’t realize they’re being abusive, and changes, deserves a punishment far worse than I can come up with.",NEGATIVE
"Im sorry if this is inappropriate as this is such a sad story, but can someone please tell me the name of the song in the intro? Ty",NEGATIVE
"I feel so bad for Cody, and the other kids. These parents can go to hell. This breaks my heart.",NEGATIVE

I wanna call the cops,NEGATIVE

"9,999th comment!",POSITIVE
"every child deserves parents, but not every parent deserves a child. especially not these two clueless fucks.",NEGATIVE
How do you know you have gone too far with a prank and it's abusive...read the viewers comments on the video. If every single parent is saying...you could offer me a million dollars and I'd never do that to my child...then you know you've crossed the line.,NEGATIVE

"Congratulations Daddy0five, you are no longer the worst family channel. Ruby Frankie/8 passengers are now the worst. Now you’re just in second place.",NEGATIVE
13:04 I was literally just about to come comment that exact thing. I couldn’t imagine living in that house. Those poor kids,NEGATIVE
"Emphasis: ""deranged fans.""  America gets sicker and sicker with this dysfunctional behavior blogged.  Child Abuse has to be intervened upon or it repeats itself.  Worst of all is Youtube capitalizing on this sick behavior/abuse.   These 2 ""parents"" are as sadistic as Ruby Franke.  How can people watch them destroy their child, Cody.  Cody is in deep, deep pain and entire fam continues to pile on.  I hate it when kids get the Oppositional Defiant Disorder diagnosis--that follows them forever, when most of the time, those children are just acting out because of the severe trauma they've experienced.
Who was the mindless, possibly corrupt judge who shortened the Martin's sentences?
He/she needs to be outed and exposed.",NEGATIVE
I am really glad to hear that Cody and Emma were taken away from him. I think it sucks that the authorities took so long to take notice of the kids lives when they were being recorded every single day.,NEGATIVE
i just got stared on youtube and it was in the midlle of this drama.,POSITIVE
"This is just evil. Treating anyone like that, especially children, disgusts me. You have to be a truly awful, broken, vile human being to be able to sleep at night knowing of your actions.",NEGATIVE
"This is so disgusting all the kids need to be taken away, they are going to be so damaged when they grow up! Those people are sick af",NEGATIVE
"It feels like all family channels are just the parents using the kids for money, but I know that not every single one is like that.
Just get a job, instead of exploiting your kids.",NEGATIVE
"That ""I'm filming you because the fans want you back"" sounds really really forced and insincere. Odds are that the despicable man never left the channel and just forced the other kids into keeping up the YouTube business until they could slowly reintroduce that monster to YouTube.",NEGATIVE
song in the Intro??,NEGATIVE
These parents do not want to run into me on the street!,NEGATIVE
Cody can come live with me! Nobody deserves that shit.,NEGATIVE

There’s nothing wrong with the Binghams,POSITIVE
your thumbnail made me throw away my phone.  so creepy,NEGATIVE
/r/raisedbynarcissists but the parents provide video evidence.,POSITIVE
"I feel so bad for cody. He was clearly the scapegoat child and i know what that looks like and how that negativity impacts a person. And how the parents treating that kid like that affects how the other siblings feel. 

My brother was the scapegoat and i have a lot of other reasons for having issues with him but even i admit that he was treated unfairly in our family. Anytime something happened he would be the first person to get blamed. Even i knew that if i did something i could easily pin it on him and i felt justified in doing that.

Now like i said i have a lot of issues with my brother and he actually did do a lot of shit that im not going to get into",NEGATIVE
"I can't finish this video, watching poor Cody be the whipping boy for an entire family is too much. Based on the comments, it looks like he's out of there and I truly hope he's doing better",NEGATIVE
"The laugh at 23:11 feels like one from a pyschopath, it hurts to see these kids get yelled at from their parents for some clicks on the internet",NEGATIVE

This is definetly one of the best videos i’ve ever watched,POSITIVE
I had a pulse in 2017 but never heard of these people. We aren’t all perpetually online,NEGATIVE
i fell bad for these kids and i also put the blame not just in the parents but in myself and all others that watched it and did nothing this is the saddest part this could have been stoped from long away,NEGATIVE
I have heard of this but never knew just how bad is was. Thank you for doing this.,POSITIVE

Edit:Jake has been the worst when it comes to looks and the worst of the siblings tormenting Cody",NEGATIVE
"I remember watching one of these videos years ago. I immediately thought what horrible parents these people are. Who punishes their kids on camera or pranks them. 
I’m sure I’d look horrible yelling at my child and the embarrassment for my kid would be enormous and last a lifetime.
Any parents who use their kids as content should be banned from social media. I want my child to live a normal healthy life and have a chance. Any parent who chooses to use their children to gain fame is criminal. Just look at child stars and see how their life went. 
Children should be protected not used to gain their parents notoriety.",NEGATIVE

This is the absolute worst.,NEGATIVE
These parents are complete psychopaths,NEGATIVE
"These people are disgusting. The blatant favoritism and special treatment of some kids is awful. The fact that people like this actually exist is genuinely vile to me. Doing something yourself just to get an excuse to scream, yell at, berate, and punish a child, that you are supposed to be caring for, and who didn't even do anything is sick and twisted. Turning a child's siblings on him, likely because they see how Cody is treated and don't want to be treated that way and also because they are mimicking the parent's clear hatred towards him. It is vile and sickening. Watching this video was genuinely difficult for me because these parents' behaviors genuinely make me nauseous. I hope all of these children are okay and safe and are able to live happy lives, especially Cody.",NEGATIVE

gotta love the US child protective services. They never do anything ever unless they are forced to over the course of years.,NEGATIVE
Mike and Heather need to be in prison for horrific child abuse for the rest of their lives,NEGATIVE
Bullying your kids is just unfathomable to me.,NEGATIVE
What the actual fuck???? I am borderline in tears because of how they treated Cody. Holy hell!!! Who are these people!!!!!,NEGATIVE
Established tittles is a known scam. So cool you’re trying to scam your subs for money.  There is no plot of land there is no real tittle.  Hope the little bit of money was worth your reputation.,NEGATIVE
..he looks like my gth grade social studies teacher..,NEGATIVE
"I remember seeing a clip of Emma getting hit and pushed while sitting at the table, screaming at her brothers for bullying her while ""dad"" was filming and laughing. It even went to getting hit behind the knees and falling on the floor, dragged around while she was obviously distressed and mad, crying and screaming. When she started to fight back again, ""dad"" and ""stepmom"" just started laughing hysterically. That was the clip that made me so, so disgusted and horrified for her. I'm glad to learn she's away from all of this along Cody ; they deserve normalcy and safety. I've seen a clip of her recently talking back to martin's fans (or just the Martin family, I don't really know, but props to her either way) telling them her mom isn't abusive, and to fuck off. Relieved to see glimpses of her, even if I do hope for both of them to stay far away from those communities and internet spaces. I hope they can heal and live happier now that they are away from those freaks calling themselves parents.",POSITIVE
What about the other kids. They need to be removed as well.,NEGATIVE
"You know what I hate to say this, but I was just waiting to see the news that this kid took his own life because what the fuck man, that kid is not gonna trust anybody when he grows up parents don’t understand how much of an influence they have on kids when are younger and how fucked up they can be when they’re older",NEGATIVE
i feel so bad for cody that poor baby,NEGATIVE
"My heart goes out to Cody and Emma...I hope those kids (maybe young adults now?) are in or are heading toward a better place mentally and emotionally...

seeing the ""pranks"" Martin (think that was his name) ""played"" on Cody was absolutely disgusting and made my stomach crawl with horror and disgust.. People like These two don't deserve kids. Disgusting...I saw this as an emotional abuse survivor.",NEGATIVE
I feel bad for cody. These parents are assholes.,NEGATIVE
"Horrible parents, just horrible.",NEGATIVE
4:46 if they said yes there abusive..the parents wouldn’t post the video…uh..how is this proving anything? Lol,NEGATIVE

I know this is an older video, but it was very well done and a good introduction to the channel",POSITIVE
"Different to see defranco actually do something useful for once. Opposite his usual, useless shill trash.",NEGATIVE
I feel bad for Cody but no one is talking about his sister I feel bad for both of them it’s so sad to have parents like this I would actually just leave the house i feel so bad for Cody an his sister just imagine if they died in that house with all of the pranks that man did to them just imagine it.,NEGATIVE

Makes me sick,NEGATIVE
These parents are so DEMENTED!😩😡🤬,NEGATIVE
"This is perverse.  I mean it quite literally, people were tuning in to see the torment.  Because that's what they enjoy.  I cannot understand how this was allowed on any platform.
If he had ODD, they sure as hell didnt help him manage it.
His siblings defended him in early videos from what I can see, but later on they'd learned to just join in.
Also, the mum. She's claiming ignorance but a 'temporary visit' doesn't 'become more permanent' unless you let it.  
The kids deserve better all round.",NEGATIVE
As a parent it is hard for me to watch this. I have childhood traumas because of my dad but i never want my kid to go though what i went through so i make damn sure that my traumas wont affect my child.  Just because what was done to me does not mean i need to place them on to my child my job is to protect my child NOT to cause trauma. These children will need therapy one way or the other when that realization hits home that their parents failed them  this is more then just messed up.,NEGATIVE
Heather is and example of how men (narcissists) love a good dummy,POSITIVE
Hearing rose side is so annoying she sounds like a liar  as a mother nobody can take my kids!!!! Nobody can label my kids !!!!,NEGATIVE
The mother or father didn’t deserve Cody poor parenting!!!!!,NEGATIVE
To just yell at your child for nothing and mad he’s yelling back they gave him ODD if any damn thing,NEGATIVE
I feel so bad for Cody  omg I’m so sorry he had to go through thats hopefully he’s one of the kids removed  to put this child through stuff and make it seem like he’s a problem,NEGATIVE
Hearing that’s woman say that about thats child grinds my gears and watching chil abuse cases any parent that wants to label their child with ODD is crazy,NEGATIVE
These people are real REAL lucky that those kids were taken away before they could get ahold of weapons. This is the kind of hell that pushes people past the breaking point. I hope they never have to see them again.,NEGATIVE
Don't think we Didn't notice that editing???? GRL FREAKING GRILLEDD,NEGATIVE
"Funny story. Not really but it’s a story.
I saw them in a mall once and they were acting so terribly to Cody and Emma. The parents were yelling and the other siblings were yelling as well about something that apparently the two had done at a store. I felt so bad but I was a kid so I didn’t know what to do. Then only two months later, I heard about then leaving the household. I can’t tell you that I was upset. I felt so relieved. As someone who deals with a terrible family, I can’t begin to tell you how happy their leaving of that household made me. Whenever people leave a place that abuses them, I feel this amazing sense of relief. I’m so glad that their pain is over but it should have never happened in the first place.",POSITIVE
"poor cody, i hope his parents life gets worse",NEGATIVE
That poor little boy. Good god I’ll adopt him…,NEGATIVE

An immature idiot!!,NEGATIVE
I absolutely HATE pranksters😢😢,NEGATIVE
"These are still mentally developing kids, clearly not taught healthy coping mechanisms by their shit parents, and living 24/7 in a super-stressful environment. Of course they're going to rebel and act up. Some people just should not be allowed to have kids.",NEGATIVE
"20:45
""That's messed up."" 

The kid looks like he's in the 3rd grade, and has more maturity than everyone present in the video combined. I really hope Cody is happy nowadays, and living a better life.",POSITIVE
"As someone who has had a bad child (diagnosed with ptsd)
This hits deep and brings back horrible memories",NEGATIVE
"Oh my goodness… I’ve never heard about this case. I can’t even believe this went on for however long it did. Poor baby boy, I truly hope Cody is living a peaceful life now. 😢",NEGATIVE
"This channel is the definition of: ""It's just a prank bro!""",NEGATIVE
Seems like Cody was totally the target of all the evil “pranks” (abuse) it was totally abuse in a different way. But totally abuse!,NEGATIVE
This video was very thorough. Thank you.,POSITIVE
"The stuff these parents do is very idiotic

Thats not how parenting works",NEGATIVE
Cody actually seems like the normal one in the family! It’s absolutely painful to watch the emotional abuse they put him through. I wonder how many “behaviors” he would have in a healthy home. 🙏🏽,NEGATIVE
"My question is, what kind of people think this sort of thing is funny? It's downright appalling.",NEGATIVE
Can i just say i love the quality of your videos. Youtube recommended you to me yesterday and its been awesome. Love the intros,POSITIVE
"I hate these parents. 
This shit makes me so sick. These degenerates don’t deserve the title “parents”",NEGATIVE
This is so uncomfortable to watch. And WHO THE HECK was watching their channel??? Shame on them too.,NEGATIVE
I doubt Cody even has odd he is probably just abused and angry about it.,NEGATIVE
You guys have no fucking idea on how to be parents,NEGATIVE
Why was the intro so tuff tho?,NEGATIVE
"I’m gonna say this again, because I cannot believe how many people are just not letting it sink in… The very platform you’re watching this video on is the very platform that was OK with children being abused for monetary gain. So how do we know the channel we’re watching right now isn’t gonna end up being a cesspool of hideousness? 

Let that sink in. I cannot wait until Google and YouTube get sued into oblivion.",NEGATIVE
"It disgusts me that children are the only class of people in society it's seen as acceptable, or even recommended, to break or steal their property, cut them off from friends and family, physically and verbally assualt them, and publicly humiliate them. They are basically property, and they only obtain ownership of themselves upon reaching 18. 

As a side note, I feel obligated to inform the creator that established titles may be a scam.",NEGATIVE
If there wasn’t an audience for it and a distribution channel (GOOGLE/YOUTUBE) he wouldn’t have done it. Raging narcissist/child abuser was being egged on by corporate interests and viewers. That’s what’s so ultimately disturbing.,NEGATIVE
God damn that poor kid.,NEGATIVE
I can’t with this…I just can’t the kids are literally way MORE mature than the adults and all the pain the children got makes me feel so sad for them I feel so sorry for Cody and Emma,NEGATIVE
This shit is infuriating! Makes me hug my boys a little closer. I can’t imagine doing this kinda shit to my boys.,NEGATIVE
THAT'S MESSED UP - Cody speaking the truest words,POSITIVE
How are those fkrs not in jail?,NEGATIVE
The kids Cody is going to have one crazy villain arc. I wouldn't be surprised if he hurts them later in life.,NEGATIVE
"I've never seen these fools until now. Disgusting.

That poor baby. My heart breaks for Cody. 😢",NEGATIVE
"I can't even imagine how much trauma these children, even the ones who got it 'easy', are struggling with. I hope to God they're able to get therapy. It sickens me to my core that there are honestly people who defend these monsters. 😥",NEGATIVE
please stay away from established titles theyre scam artists,NEGATIVE
Honestly this is hard to watch. Literally mental and emotional abuse to a child :(,NEGATIVE
"As a mom, my heart just broke for those poor kids. Never ever looked one of my kids with so much fear on their faces at me and never ever will they have to, parents are supposed to be a safe place for their kids. I will never understand how parents can hurt their children mentally or physically on purpose, and in this case for entertainment, this is just sick.",NEGATIVE
Absolutely vile.,NEGATIVE
Be a miracle if that kid doesn't grow up to be an addict of some sort.,NEGATIVE
Heather is a disgusting monster.,NEGATIVE
The parents are the bottom of the barrel.  What kind of mother does this???  And the father is a man child.  Both losers.,NEGATIVE
Why are these people not locked up?!?,NEGATIVE
daddyofive is a disipotment to Maryland,NEGATIVE
"Feedback: the music, why the music choice.",POSITIVE
Mike is the biggest meathead I've ever seen in the whole of my life.,NEGATIVE
"yeah, Mike is a narcissistic monster who will clearly prioritize his ego over the wellbeing of anyone or anything else. But the real evil here is that woman. She doesn't come across as callous, unempathic  and irresponsible ilke Mike, she is actively malicious, taking actual joy in Cody's suffering. The combination of these two personalities... my god it's just weapons-grade awful.

Also, who the f#ck do they think they are fooling with those outfits at the end there? Cosplaying as the Flanders isn't going to magically make you more believable. 😂",NEGATIVE
"Those kids should probably sue the parents. Is this content was making money, you should be entitled to it along with damages.",NEGATIVE
"damn, feels like my parents",POSITIVE
"''its just a prank bruh''
IT AINT THAT FUNNY BRO",NEGATIVE
Cody and Emma will take FOREVER to trust another adult again. They were picked on the most because they weren't the mom's biological children.,NEGATIVE
People who do this to children need to spend a week in that prison with the booty warrior.,NEGATIVE
those kids didnt deserve it,NEGATIVE
Daddysuckme05,NEGATIVE
"I feel so bad for Cody. I think at least 50% of his bad behavior came from his nasty parents. His parents kept framing him and punishing him for stuff he did not do, they even tried to cover it up with ""It was just a prank."" He was constantly abused and his father had no common sense. I'm worried the parents might be punishing him off camera. But they may have changed their ways.",NEGATIVE
Mike and Heather are gonna go to hell. And they’re going to have to live every day knowing what they did to Cody and Emma.,NEGATIVE
The fact that there are hundreds of thousands of people out there who would enjoy this is just sickening.,NEGATIVE
"38:53 ""Why are you recording me?"" ""Because the fans want you to come back to YouTube.""

Yeah sure....that was a completely genuine moment. Not at all a line he made the kid say.

"I genuinely hope Cody and Emma can find happiness.
My heart goes out to you, Cody and Emma.",POSITIVE
Sometimes it's best if certain people aren't allowed to be parents.,NEGATIVE

How much money are you making from Cody's pain!?😠,NEGATIVE

Do your research! And remove that crap.",NEGATIVE
"This is making my blood boil!!!!!! As a mother this breaks my heart!!!! How can you be ok with your kid disliking your other kid! I always tell my boys they need to always be there for each other because friends come and go but family will always be there! I can’t believe people are ok with watching this and making these kids suffer!!! Poor Cody, may he not be affected by this!! These kids need to be taken away from those people!!",NEGATIVE
Why in the world are they still parents at all?  Terrifying.,NEGATIVE
Daddyo5 looks exactly like the postal dude. Like ffs i dont mean to profile but come on man,NEGATIVE
As soon as I saw the Established Titles scam bullshit I paused to write this comment and will not watch anymore. Should have re-uploaded without promoting a company dedicated to scamming people.,NEGATIVE
They tortured that small child. I was disgusted seeing how they treated him. Cant imagine how betrayed and ganged up on he felt by his own parents no less. Ridiculous.,NEGATIVE
"I just want to say, its not 5, but its close. Im the oldest brother of 4, and seeing Cody, clearly hes not even a bad kid, or remotely close. So many times during this video, i just felt like: ""WHAT THE F*** IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?"" and ""If i were there i would punch that smirk off their face and call it a damn prank.""",NEGATIVE

The thumbnail is terrifying,NEGATIVE
What the fuck did Cody do,NEGATIVE
I wanna give cody a hug tell him its going to be ok and that they're assholes not him,POSITIVE
The worst thing about this is the people who feeds this kind of channel whet idea.,NEGATIVE
This happens more than you think that a child will go for a visit and is a fight to get them back and years to repair the damage to the kids,POSITIVE
yeah this is pretty sadistic,NEGATIVE
The only positive i can take from this is thank god they were narcissistic and money driven enough to display their behaviours publicly on YouTube. There are a million other households like this that aren't available to public subjection,NEGATIVE
Mike and Heather's voices are like nails on a chalkboard,NEGATIVE
I've NEVER seen anything like it. These Parents are Committing EMOTIONAL TERRORISM on their own offspring. HOME is supposed to be a SAFE Place,NEGATIVE
"Well,like they say, there goes 10 min I will never get back",NEGATIVE
This is beyond cruel. I have always hated pranks. I don't find anything funny about these.,NEGATIVE
Honestly DaddyOFive looks like an adult version of Sid from Toy Story,NEGATIVE
I was astonished of how horrible this is. I paused the video 4 or 5 times to just think about how bad these parents are. But I really hope that the kids are doing fine and living a somewhat happy and safe life.,NEGATIVE
How are those parents legally allowed to post videos online still??? This is so so so depressing.,NEGATIVE
"I think these people should be in jail.  There's no way I  would have any contact with my ""parents "" after leaving home. They are both narcissistic,  abusive people.  Look at the way they pit the other children against the youngest two. I am watching him claim the videos are fake, calling emotional abuse pranks, and using the abuse to make money. The older kids seem completely bought into their parents evil. This is just shameful.",NEGATIVE
apparently  the three older brothers have got a channel that the GRANPARENTS made for them.  that's where the videos are being reuploaded again?   they changed the sites name a few times now to get around youtube.,NEGATIVE
"their videos are still up......just found them   Archives re uploads it says,  of course no comments BUT the videos are still running.  you use them to educate,  others are using the videos for likes and money....and propagate more abuse.",NEGATIVE
"What a sorry excuse for parents,  I'm totally disgusted.  I hope those parents go to jail for abuse.   All in the name of a ""prank"".  Ignorant adults.",NEGATIVE
I feel so bad for Cody :(,NEGATIVE

"this is a serious topic. i hope DaddyOFive gets banned. not only that, but i hope all of his kids go to a better family. all of them. TOGETHER. then they go to prison and see what they have done to their children.",POSITIVE
I dont like the way cody has treated that way,NEGATIVE
"When I was in middle school my parents looked up to Daddy O Five and did ""pranks"" like these without filming them. Like they shut off the power for a whole day then proceeded to blame it on my siblings and I for over using it",NEGATIVE
"""Was anybody traumatized?"" First, Cody's response ""I don't even know what that word means"" is one of the many indicators that Cody is actually highly intelligent and mature. (Behavior therapist and child&youth crisis therapist here)
Then the dumb question itself: yup, that's how you measure the level of trauma: as YOUR VICTIMS (who are loyal to you as a result of the cycle of abuse) whether they were traumatized. Holy shit.
Those ""pranks"" hard to watch.
As far as I'm concerned, I'd fuck both """"parents"""" in jail for life.",NEGATIVE
"The obvious child abuse is one thing, but the number of equally trashy viewers is astonishing. Why no one called Social Services??? 

I want to hug and comfort Cody so much. ❤😢 I hope he's loved and appreciated now. 😥 My heart is breaking for him",POSITIVE
"The emotional abuse these trashy """"parents"""" made their children go through is blood boiling and sickening. 🤮🤮 That Mike dude is a classic school bully",NEGATIVE

Kody's tears are real! Ugh These people are mentally abusing their kids! Ugh #TheseParentsAreLiars,NEGATIVE
"Someone needs to remind YouTubers (and honestly parents in general) that children are their own people not someone to project their own insecurities and bad traits onto. First this idiot, then that 8 passengers monster. And i wouldn't doubt there's more. Its insane. They're insane. I'd say the internet was a mistake, but i had parents who did that projection bullshit too, but unlike these kids i don't have the documentation to prove it. They frame it like its a different life as a way to deal with things, but its much too intense, and later on in life the kids will need therapy to unpack it. I've been through that. I will say though that there is a light at the end of the tunnel for these kids, because while i can't keep up with the jonses, i like what i've made of my life and have done/am doing with my healing trauma. My parents were just still immature, not violent, inappropriate, or culty, thank gosh. But i still went through hell as they were working through their stuff. Its difficult to talk candidly about childhood trauma....suffice to say i am doing better these days, and both keenly know what not to do, as well as actively rejecting ever having children. There's hope for these kids, but they'll probably be about 30 by the time things get to be okay. They'll have to be brave when they didn't have to be, but the deep dives are worth it, in a safe space surrounded by found loved ones who will take care of them through it.",NEGATIVE
"if you have to lie about it being fake, you know its wrong",NEGATIVE
"the boy in the box case isnt too dissimilar to this family, except theres a bathroom and some access.....trust me if the abuse was taken out and they were offered a box, theyd probably take it",NEGATIVE
"I remember when I was a little kid (18 now) watching this content in horror and confusion. Wondering why this was allowed or treated normal.
I'm so glad that those kids got taken away from that horrible environment.",NEGATIVE

"Nothing like blaming the kids! These 2 parents are about as classy as a turd that won’t flush, I have made millions of $$$ over a lifetime and I’m contacting Cody and Emma’s mother to offer to pay for any legal services she may need to keep those kids in her custody, those of you who know me!

"i remember when i was younger (maybe 12?) i would watch these videos and be incredibly desensitized because it's sort of stuff i was already used to

Cody and emma are obese now btw,NEGATIVE
This man gives Maryland a bad name.,NEGATIVE
"the ""parents"" are DEMONS. Even that is an insult to DEMONS.",NEGATIVE
I really hope cody is doing better now..❤😢,POSITIVE

Bro wtf is that thumbnail lol.,NEGATIVE
The thumbnail is just both of them doing jerma Sus face,NEGATIVE
"Let's not pretend the bio mom didn't give Cody to his dad. If she wanted him, she would have physically gotten him back. She would've driven to get him and would've mauled anyone in her way.",NEGATIVE
the parents are criminals but why does the beginning music in the video a banger,NEGATIVE
"Ok damn, no need to have the intro be this fire",POSITIVE
I couldn't even finish this video... There are millions of people who got off on watching children being tormented by their parents. Imagine having a clout chaser for a father.,NEGATIVE
Unrelated but that intro goes hard as hell,POSITIVE
If I had a parent like this I wouldn’t have a parent like this if you know what I mean,NEGATIVE
"So glad that cody and emma got returned to their actually loving and caring biological mother.
And i'm more than over the moon that mike and heather finally got in trouble with the law, it took long another.",POSITIVE
"I used to watch this family when i was a kid, i always felt like there wasnt somthing right. Then one day i showed my dad and thats where i learnt that this sort of stuff is unacceptable",NEGATIVE
Bros 41 ain't no way,POSITIVE
Never watched his videos,NEGATIVE
"yeah, ""pranks""



we all know they weren't because why would they always do it",NEGATIVE
God. I just want to take this kid home and show him that family isn't supposed to be cruel.,POSITIVE
I almost cried because of this,NEGATIVE
"what makes this even worse is that I don't agree with the title. I have seen worse unfortunately, where there have even been family channels where the parents murdered the children.",NEGATIVE
"The kid deserves better. But the parents don’t deserve anything, the parents don’t deserve to be parents the parents deserve shit. The kid deserves so much better, the kid deserves to be loved and appreciated. The kid deserves to be loved, understood, and respected. I hope the kids are doing so much better but the adults deserve nothing they deserve shit.",NEGATIVE
"This is disgusting. The channel was just an pretense for straight up child abuse . Even after they got all that back lash, they kept making the same videos and lying that it was fake. Why didn't they just switch to fake pranks? It was all about abuse. These people should be in prison.",NEGATIVE
I can’t even begin to imagine the level of PTSD these kids are experiencing right now. Really hope they’re doing ok.,POSITIVE
mike reminds me alot of my stepdad (im not in that house anymore),NEGATIVE
Poor babies. I hope they can somehow have peace after being treated like this. This was truly psychological and physical  hell for these kids. I have never seen this guys' videos and these literally made me cry. Imagine being in these kids' shoes.,NEGATIVE
"When Cody shocks society later on and the dad testifies in court, let Daddy O tell it to the judge.",POSITIVE
"""they continued entertaining the remaining fanbase"" how can such twisted people have fanbases",NEGATIVE
"""its a joke"" no it is horrible parenting",NEGATIVE
what the hell did cody even do? just existing is diffulcult,NEGATIVE
18:00 i saw that laptop on the big bang theory,NEGATIVE
i remember seeing this video after watching a different one the thumbnail was scary!,POSITIVE
"I love pranks, but it's very easy to go way too far.",NEGATIVE
My heart is seriously breaking. I’ve heard of this before but not the whole story and omg!! I hope so much those kids are far far away from their extremely abusive parents.,POSITIVE
"""So what do you do for a living?""
""I gaslight my kids.""
""No I said for living""
""Yeah I make millions of dollars""",NEGATIVE
Cody deserves better,NEGATIVE
these parents... full of themselves and bullies,NEGATIVE
"i feel really bad for them, especially cody",NEGATIVE
Oh God I remember following this crap when it was happening. It was heartbreaking then and it's heartbreaking now.,NEGATIVE
Seems like Cody was the scapegoat of the family. I've been a scapegoat in many situations. I know how much it messes with you,NEGATIVE
IMPRACTICAL JOKERS,NEGATIVE
"It's a little unfortunate that you don't address the established titles controversy, it might me more disappointing but I don't feel like checking when the contraversy hit, so idk if this was made before or after, I'd honestly rather not know",NEGATIVE
"what the version of nostalgia but for awful things,thats what i felt when i hear DO5 yell go to your room in the beginning, and yes when i was young i watched them, only now i realized how horrible they were",NEGATIVE
"Okay, the thumbnail was really creepy 😭😭💀",POSITIVE

"cody is one of those ""name a character that's been through more pain than ______"" irl",NEGATIVE
"God this broke my damn heart. I have a 5 year old son and i couldnt imagine doing anything like this to him, or to any child. Some ppl dont deserve children at all. Disgusting. And all those people watching it and agreeing of what they were doing to that little boy.",NEGATIVE
"Ending up in your fathers care over questionable avenues? Check. Abused by a father and stepmother named martin? Check. Literally a redheaded stepchild? Check. Constant cries for help ignored while mother fights courts to save her child? Check. Big house and youtube money? Negative but doesn't change a damned thing. 

When this channel first hit trending I saw through the whole thing. Cody is a walking flashback for me every time this channel is brought up. I hope all the kids, but especially him find some proper help, some peace, and I hope they find some success and happiness in life without such awful ""caretakers"". And when you find that success, don't let them even attempt to take it from you. They will demonize you, berate you, guilt you, and blame you.  Let them. Abusers don't change. Keep them away. Surround yourself with people who truly do love you and will help protect you from those people. Be strong. Be kind. And when you have concerns for others, speak up loudly.",NEGATIVE
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊,POSITIVE
"I love how they talk about Cody’s behavioral issues as if they aren’t the direct cause of said issues. The lack of self awareness in today’s society is astounding, Daddy O’ Five shines a horrifying spotlight on the way a lot of people behave in every day life. Depressing 😢",POSITIVE
I’ve never heard of DaddyofFive until now but the vid at 12:06… I swear I’ve seen it before!!!,POSITIVE
"this is one of the reasons why I don't like people pranking me because I know I got issues and if someone pranks me like I be seeing them public pranks on random people, I just don't know what I would do.",NEGATIVE
I am now faulted that my last name is Martin.,NEGATIVE
rotary park  is safe after  dark,POSITIVE
These guys look like ohare in the thumbnail 💀💀,NEGATIVE
What an absolute embarrassment this couple is. Mike especially. He's SOOO desperate for fame. I hope he ends up alone and forgotten in his old age.,NEGATIVE
16:38 that user is definitely a pedo btw,NEGATIVE
"Being trauma informed, this brought me to tears. As the mom says "" Is anyone traumatized""? That statement was so ignorant to ask children in the moment, because trauma tends to be acute within 30 days, prolonged within a year, or even complex trauma you don't how you've been impacted until TIME has passed. 

My dear Cody may develop disorganized attachment when he get's older. I pray he doesn't and is healing. He has such a sensitive kind heart.",POSITIVE
"The way the parents yell at Cody is terrifying, almost triggering for me. Its similar to how my father would treat me as a child. I hope all of those kids are able to get away from those awful people that call themselves their “parents”",NEGATIVE
heather looks like a missing woman which was killed while she was pregnant..,NEGATIVE
Great animation! Horrible parents.,POSITIVE
"The fact that Heather texted to Rose, ""youre not even a fraction of woman and mother I am"" REALLY REALLY hit a nerve. My step mum was awful to me, and always attacked my mum saying stuff like ""im a better mum than you"" ""[my name] is more mynchild than he is yours"" etc etc. I swear to God, I hope Heather and Mike have the worst rest of their lives.",NEGATIVE
"I genuinely feel bad for them,i hope the children have healed",POSITIVE
"I feel so bad for cody, as someone who was attacked by my family due to mental issues this is absolutely disturbing and disgusting.",NEGATIVE
"Same parents to say ""Why don't my kids talk to me anymore?!?!""",NEGATIVE
You know what no one ever addresses with this channel? How much of a psycho Jake is! Like seriously that kid gets way too much pleasure out of beating up his siblings and is a borderline sociopath with how he shows no emotion at all! Hell it wouldn't surprise me if it turns out he was molesting one of them with how he has a weird obsession with spanking his brothers! There is nothing normal about any of that!,NEGATIVE
Well only in america..,POSITIVE
I was exactly tje 2900000 veiwer,POSITIVE
"I remember watching a few of their videos when that channel was still up. I had to stop watching, because every single one got more and more disturbing.",NEGATIVE
"This absolutely DISGUSTS me! I feel so sorry for Cody. Shame on these PoS parents and shame on their heartless fans! This is the very example of the phrase ‘All children deserve parents, but not all parents deserve children’.",NEGATIVE
"i know its a long time after this was posted, it is still heart breaking nonetheless! putting children through what can only be described as torture, all for clicks and money, suggests that neither 'parent' should be allowed anywhere near a child again! more over, using Cody as the butt of their 'games' must surely have contributed to his ODD. both children being taken away from their biological father and step mother is the best result, not only for Cody and Emma but also their biological mother too. lets just hope that they dont grow up remembering just how nasty their father is!",POSITIVE
Bro established titles is a scam 😂,NEGATIVE
My brother has ODD and has his fair share of behavioral problems. I can't imagine purposefully exacerbating that by 'pranking' them and making them feel unloved,NEGATIVE
Someone help me restore my hope and faith in humanity. I don't even believe in god or hell anymore. *I don't feel anything.*,NEGATIVE
"03:23 that didn't age well, combined with the fact that you are talking about fake people inthis video, you took the money of scammers without checking who give you the money.... are you pissed?",NEGATIVE
Wow this is the first time I’ve seen your channel and I just wanna let you know that I think your editing skills are phenomenal! 🎉,POSITIVE
"The horror of this family disturbs me. Even as someone who lived in a verbally and mentally(sometimes even physically) abusive household as a child, this is still infinitely worse. My favorite quote for situations like this is that, while all children deserve parents, not all parents deserve children.
And this is exhibited further by the father stating that his ""haters"" are at fault for not seeing the humor in mental abuse. I hate YouTube ""pranksters.""",NEGATIVE
That thumblail tho,POSITIVE
"12:39 foxy in FNaF 2:


I am still mad this happens. If this would happen to my brother I would help him a lot.",NEGATIVE
The Daddy0five parents are the absolute worst people I have seen,NEGATIVE
That poor boy :(,NEGATIVE
Poor kids their dad is making their life a living HELL,NEGATIVE
This dad is INSANE IN A BAD WAY,NEGATIVE
"Based on the comments and the early video warnings, I have to move on. I can’t even watch this one. I’m going to have to go and find these people.",NEGATIVE
Poor kids but especially Cody... :(,NEGATIVE
I feel so bad for those children,NEGATIVE
ive herd of these poeple...i thought thier videos were staged.,NEGATIVE
"This was 6 years ago man leave him alone i mean its a bad ""prank"" but hes a good person now",POSITIVE
I would've genuinely commited suicide the first few days if my parents had started to do something like this.,NEGATIVE
it's funny because he paid for the xbox he broke,NEGATIVE
"Considering recent developments in 8 Passengers lore, I think it's safe to say this video's title is outdated.",NEGATIVE
This fucking pisses me off. The fact that these parents have the audacity to abuse their family and use them for fucking internet points,NEGATIVE
"This is unforgivable. What these two fuckers did to Cody will not only haunt them for the rest of their lives, but it has permanently changed Cody's life. He will now forever have the label of the kid from DaddyOFive who ""couldn't take a joke"" when the ""jokes"" were psychological and sometimes physical abuse.",NEGATIVE
"Like for real. I was bullied. All through school. Mostly in the same cruel and vicious ways that Cody is being bullied in this video. THE DIIFERENCE, HOWEVER, is that my family, and my home, WAS SAFE. My parents loved me and tried their absolute best for me. The idea that this poor baby couldn't even be safe and loved in his own home is so fucking infuriating that I honestly can't accurately put it into words.",NEGATIVE
Those poor babies :( The fact that those two parents aren't currently rotting UNDER the jail is such a fucking travesty of justice,NEGATIVE
"Not to bash your ad, but I’m 99% sure anyone can put “Lord” on their dating profile if they so please. No land owning necessary!",POSITIVE
asking the kids if their parents are abusive will never work. theyll either lie or theyll genuinely believe their parents arent abusive just because their parents say they arent.,NEGATIVE
Anyone who liked the DaddyOfive channel during the time their kids were under the siege of abuse are the worst of people and deserve trash for everything,NEGATIVE
cody is the best behaved out of all of them he literally just gets bullied and gets upset and people don’t like kids who cry apparently,POSITIVE
"At 35:39,the look in the moms face looks like she knows that she's not getting out of the situation with ""it was just a prank! hahaahaa"" This isn't just a prank anymore.",NEGATIVE
"i agree with david, and cody doesn't deserve any of this, neither do any of the five ;((",NEGATIVE
"This is the prime example of “Every child deserves a parent, but not every parent deserves a child.”",NEGATIVE
truly sick case hopefully these kids get a new dad soon,NEGATIVE
Cody deserves better😢,NEGATIVE
This guy and his second girlfriend are people who should not be parents,NEGATIVE
“Vanity working on a weak mind produces every kind of mischief.” -Jane Austen,POSITIVE
Not the Established Titles ad 💀 I know this is an old video but dang lol,NEGATIVE
They hated Coty because he didn't want to play their stupid games. What a monster.,NEGATIVE
"Im new to this channel, i may be a year late but damn.. this actually makes me feel happy that my parents only emotionally neglect me. 
my Prayers go to the kids.",POSITIVE
This is why I can't fucking stand prank videos. I never ever have thought one was funny. They are psychotic. Only psychos terrorize people,NEGATIVE
Not sure sentences are abuse. Especially only 25. I had to write hundreds for just forgetting to put my name on my paper in school,NEGATIVE
This is sad </3 they deserve better,NEGATIVE
"I honestly just don’t get it. How fucking deranged and delusional do you have to be to abuse your kids like this???? I’m a mother of three kids each under 10, and I can barely send them to time out without feeling a bit bad. How can you scream and curse at your kid, tell them they’re getting sent away, refusing to include them, and belittle them to their breaking point??? This is so fucking disgusting to me in every way. These people deserve to take a trip to jail and get yelled at there in the same way they yell at their kids. These people are actual monsters",NEGATIVE
"YOUR EDITOR NEEDS A RAISE, AND IF ITS YOU, YOU NEED A RAISE",NEGATIVE
"i would love to see even one of these fraud-exposing youtube journalists get a bit of self-awareness and go back and review some of their own sponsors, like shady VPNs or open, obvious horseshit like Established Titles.",NEGATIVE
"I never found this shit funny. I have an unhinged sense of humor, I laugh at shit others would cover their mouth at in disgust. But what these kids went through including Cody is sickening, Cody especially. As someone who grew up as a troubled kid I feel for him as I see myself in him a little bit, because of that I understand the fear of heading your name being called for any given reason. I really hope Cody is doing OK now however from what I heard his piece of shit father is fighting tooth and nail to keep custody.",NEGATIVE
"I have 15 minutes to get to work. Yeah, I should start this 40 minute video. I’ll have time.",NEGATIVE
DUDE looking back on them is just awful,NEGATIVE
These people are evil! 😢 that poor baby!,NEGATIVE
i really hope cody and emma are doing good these days,POSITIVE
Nice scam sponsor dude,POSITIVE
"Ooooof every time I think I’m healed from the trauma my ex Marines dad put me through. I see things like this and the overwhelming similarities of “punishment” is outrageous. 

I might get triggered but I’m so glad videos like this exist. It reminds me that the behavior depicted is in no way normal (which can be hard for victims of abuse). I NEVER want to perpetuate this with my future children. ❤",POSITIVE
THE THUMBNA SCARED ME LOL,POSITIVE
Established titles 💀💀💀,POSITIVE
These creatures calling themselves “parents” are just vile bottom of the barrel trash,NEGATIVE
"Their comment sections are full of psychos and the parents are even worse for listening to them. They are more indifferent to their children so they’ll say stupid things like “Punish him more” or “Humiliate him!” 

The parents are the worst ones in this scenario. They made out Cody to be the black sheep so of course the audience is going to give him the “Meg” treatment",NEGATIVE
"Welp, that’s not true anymore. There’s a family worse than DaddyOFive now. You can probably guess who it is. Say your guess in the replies",NEGATIVE
"Sorry Daddy o Five, there is nothing funny about abusing and traumatizing children! Adults pulling pranks on children is cruel and immature!",NEGATIVE
"As someone who has mental health problems that mean I cant always rely on my own memory and experiences, watching that small child be tormented into believing he did something he didnt do is heartbreaking.",NEGATIVE
Only 3 mins in....boring 🥱....gone,NEGATIVE
Haha calling out DeFranco bruh idiots,NEGATIVE
I'm sorry but how did these people kidnap 2 kids from rose I'm just confused about that whole part,NEGATIVE
Volcano these people,NEGATIVE
some years from now we're gonna hear three martin boys do crime i just know it,NEGATIVE
Put this man in jail. Put him in jail,NEGATIVE
The thumbnail for this video sums it all up before even watching it,NEGATIVE
This is abuse… how were they not arrested?!? Maybe I need to continue to watch.,NEGATIVE
"I could just imagine what cody must be feeling. Worthless, a failure and just a mess for the family. Just for a few views.
Wow...",NEGATIVE
"Kissing as a P r a n k 😳
To bad 
the s t d will be soo real !!",POSITIVE
"Cody has been suffering the damn most with his name in almost every video, and not only that.

he gets into most of the scenarios by being involved for no reason, despite being the destructive one.

It's sad that he gotten picked on the most back then.",NEGATIVE
Lol I’m surprised you haven’t removed the established title scam from your sponsor read,NEGATIVE
free cody,POSITIVE
"He failed to protect his biological children from their stepmom, too. It speaks volumes that the stepmom's children got the least terrible treatment under his 'care'",NEGATIVE
this is like the worst form of hazing. poor kids,NEGATIVE
My dad was a cop and he’s said the amount of times he and multiple different officers had calls at that house was horrible,NEGATIVE
"Omg... poor little Cody... I genuinly feel terrible... These parents are terrible but that's what our generation has become. A bunch of fame and power hungry people do whatever they want and have no regard for anyone else, including young children. It breaks my heart to see this...",NEGATIVE
"3:27, just to note, Established Titles is a scam",NEGATIVE
Never forget bumfights,POSITIVE
"This is so disturbing. Poor Cody. He really summed it up when he said “That’s messed up.”

Reading the responses from their viewers may have disturbed me even more.",NEGATIVE
DaddyOfive sounds like a Family guy character that somehow wanted to be a worst parent than Peter Griffin,NEGATIVE
"I do not get angry easily, but I am want to track down these parents, and [censored by me] them, I know, bold statement for this century, but every time I see Cody, I just can't stand how he's treated. I get protective older brother vibes when I see Cody, and a ""F around find out"" feeling when I see the people that were supposed to love him. Imagine this: your a 6 year old with ODD, your dad, the co-role model of your life, takes you from your other role model, your mother, and takes you to a step mom that (by the looks of it) doesn't care about you, actively standing against you going to every kids dream trip, (Disney World) and excluding you from the rest of your family, and your dad, who you think would stand up for you, (he's your biological father) but even then, he stops making nice vlogs, and starts ""pranking"" you via 1. Smashing your Xbox. 2. Yelling at you for attention on YouTube (since people back then on this platform didn't look so mentally stable in the head and liked violent freakouts from little kids, to then perceive them as ""spoiled"") and every videos comment section had people (directed at you) saying ""whack him"" ""whack him"" ""whack him"" ""whack him"" so you know you aren gonna helped by the audience, and then, one day after it all, ""INVISIBLE INK PRANK! GONE WRONG! (WE HURT CODY) 25,000 views I 30 minutes ago"" at least he lives a better life.",NEGATIVE
That intro is smoove,NEGATIVE
I’m glad I never heard of them,NEGATIVE
"“Was anybody traumatized?”
“I don’t even know what that means”
Bro Cody my poor fucking baby you are so deeply traumatized. God I hope he’s doing better now",NEGATIVE
"""YOU MADE ME GO TROUGH ALL THIS, JUST FOR A *FRIDGE*?!!!""




The kid sounds so done oml..",NEGATIVE
"Poor Cody man. As a person that grew up with wrong child syndrome, can say it sucked being treated like this. Well it was never public, but it sucked. I hope he’s doing better now.",NEGATIVE
Bros gonna be shook when he finds out the truth about his sponsors,NEGATIVE
He looks like a dirtbag mix of eminem and Limpbizkit,NEGATIVE
"When your young child with ODD tells you your behavior is messed up, you know you screwed up pretty bad as a parent. Also...taking a kid away from his mother, framing her as someone who gave up on her son just to abuse the boy for cloudt?! This couple deserves a life in prision. They turned their kids into people who think abuse is normal, they made them mistreat their own brother. Despicable!",NEGATIVE
I don’t even care but what the (insert cus here lol) happens but these people need to go to (insert another cus here lol) prison😡😡😡,NEGATIVE
Jesus christ why your intros have to slap so hard,NEGATIVE
One thing i hate more than bad parents is Established Titles,NEGATIVE
"God, i feel extremely bad for cody. Speaking as someone who was often the prime target for my family to make fun of me, if my reactions were recorded and the audience of my family's youtube subscribers literally encouraged them to abuse me even more, i would have ran away at that point.",NEGATIVE
I cried so hard watching this. My heart absolutely bleeds for these poor kids,POSITIVE
Poor kid Cody and Emma,NEGATIVE
"This just absolutely breaks my heart. As a Mom I just want to hold Cody and love him, tell him he has worth and value. How could anyone treat a child like this, let alone their own child 😞",NEGATIVE
Cody And Emma  are being abuse and the fans love it.,POSITIVE
I hugged & loved on my son so much after watching this. Some people just don’t deserve kids. Heartbreaking…,POSITIVE
Mike be like “yeah uhhh lawyers are a conflict of interest” fucking somehow and it works???,POSITIVE
16:22 💀 just why… Cody at s like this because he is being a**sed,NEGATIVE
This kid must have HORRABLE turst issues I would run away if I was him,NEGATIVE
"Did he really have ODD or did the parents set up situations to give the perception he was reactive? Did he truly have ODD or did the parents lie to the psychiatrist. 

Poor boy was the scape goat, and they literally turned the family against him.",NEGATIVE
"You need to APOLOGIZE for this video. DaddyOFive are NOT awful parents. You should be ashamed of yourself. DaddyOFive was AN INNOCENT PRANK CHANNEL AND NO ABUSE WAS PRESENT. Your video is a lie and I'm reporting this video.

ALL OF YOU COMMENTING SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES",NEGATIVE
"“So you all made me go through all this, just for a stupid prank?”
Cody is so mature.",NEGATIVE
"34:38 it’s not your family. You stole your ex’s kids, you have no right to call yourself a father, let alone of 5.",NEGATIVE
my heart has never hurt more for someone i’ve never met. cody did not deserve any of that,NEGATIVE
I really hope Cody is okay now. This is absolutely HORRIFYING and INFURIATING. I just wanna give him a hug.,NEGATIVE
I feel bad for Cody. I really hope those parents get there karma one day.,NEGATIVE
It was good to see the picture of Cody with a smile on his face after he got to go back with his mom.,POSITIVE
"I've only just heard about these people, jesus christ 😔",NEGATIVE
"This makes me sick!!! Poor kids, especially Cody 😢 this a-hole father needs a jail sentence!",NEGATIVE
Wow people are sick in the head,NEGATIVE
This was really upsetting to watch. I wish I could give Cody a huge hug and tell him that he’s loved. This brought tears to my eyes. The other kids were trained to turn on him as well. Devastating.,POSITIVE
What does the Daddy O Five family HAVE on officials there? The judge expunging and not being punitive when they disobey court orders? What is going on in Maryland,NEGATIVE
Holy shit that thumbnail is scary as fu-,NEGATIVE
Having Established Titles as your sponsor on a video about pranks and scams is probably not a good idea.  I thought they had to shut down a while back because they were trying to trick people into buying a few inches of dirt in Scotland.  I guess they were still doing business a year ago 🤷🏼‍♀️,NEGATIVE
This is down right child abuse!!!! 😡😡 These people are disgusting!! These poor children 😢,NEGATIVE
What an evil mother and father,NEGATIVE
"the thing is, this isnt the whole story so i mean at this point no videos about them is accurate. its ether all Negative, or all out of context. im not defending anyone as some things they did were wrong, but to say Rose is the right thing is fabricated. both sides had evidence of abuse",NEGATIVE
"back in 2017 i remember watching these videos, and i was one of those people that thought cody was just a little shit. come to find out in 2023 the full story and it horrified me. i had a physically and mentally abusive father and i had, and still do, have learning disorders, neurological disorders, and more so i actually understand a bit of what cody was going through",POSITIVE
"This is horrible, I wish I could punch them and hug that little kid, they traumatized him",NEGATIVE
Why is this intro so good,POSITIVE
"Oppositional defiant disorder is, in my opinion, a bullshit diagnosis. It has a history of being used as a diagnosis for non white children who are often later diagnosed with ADHD. When children with ADHD are constantly belittled and punished by their families when they genuinely can’t understand why they’ve done/not done specific things of course they’re going to be upset and react intensely.",NEGATIVE
The parents' laughter sounds like the cackling of demons,NEGATIVE
With a bit of luck they'll one day end up cellmates with the 8passengers parents and shrink.,NEGATIVE
0:01 Song name please,NEGATIVE
These parents are sycophants,NEGATIVE
"im not someone who cries, but the part where Cody is accused of the cards & ink thing is just heartbreaking.",NEGATIVE
Ah man that ad read didn't hold up well huh.,NEGATIVE
"There are now words for the types of violence I would influct on these ""adult"" ""people""... Note the placement of the quotation marks, that should give you an idea if what I think of these creatures.",NEGATIVE
"What absolutely horrid humans, Cody doesn’t deserve any of this shit and I pray that he turns out okay from all this outright abuse…Cody if you ever need help please don’t feel afraid to reach out to me, I promise you that we can get you into something more stable than this horrible treatment that you’ve experienced! 💔",NEGATIVE
My brothers aunt and uncle treated them like this. Their parents had their custody rights taken away when they where young so their aunt and uncle took them in for the government funds (they always used that money for themselves.) this behavior is abuse. They are diagnosed with ptsd,NEGATIVE
These poor children… god please let them be safe now,NEGATIVE
"Just seeing the younger kids faces of genuine disgust saddens me almost as much as it infuriates me. I actually had to skip a lot of it. Just soul crushing stuff to watch. Couldn’t even fathom going thru that. Is parenting a difficult job? Yes. As a parent, do you have bad days? Most definitely. But to watch him blatantly mentally/physically/emotionally manipulate them all for a shitty Dodge Charger or whatever Walmart special he wanted? Well buddy it looks like nobody will be visiting you in the nursing home when you get older. Enjoy your cold sponge bath, you toxic waste of space. You were supposed to be their protector, dude! I hope his kids can turn themselves around and I wish nothing but the best for them.",NEGATIVE
This is a stunning intro my man… that’s mad talent. Kudos! 🙌🏼,POSITIVE
I think the children's faces should have been censored.,NEGATIVE
It took so much for the authorities to step in because they are white. If black folk do little things we get our kids taken away. The more you know.,POSITIVE
This is blatant fucking child abuse had this go on for so long?,NEGATIVE
there is no pit in hell deep enough for the degenerate excuse for parents. imagine if the people who are supposed to love and protect you at all cost used for like this. my heart goes out to all the kids who had no choice but to endure this torture,NEGATIVE
There are few things in this world I would genuinely consider evil. But parading your abuse for sick entertainment is about as disgustingly vile as it gets. Hell is too good for these people.,NEGATIVE
I grew up like this! That poor boy. That family is so fucking twisted!!!!,NEGATIVE
"the clip of cody staying silent and looking away when tehy ""pranke"" him by leaving him alone in public got to me. Obviously I dont want to read into or speak for him but does moments where you know everyone is against you but knowing giving a reaction will be worse so you let all that hurt swell up inside you. Growing up I was the ""problem child""/""bad kid"" and I'm still seen that way to a degree. But having the cameras, and constant encouragement to continue the abuse is literal hell on earth",NEGATIVE
"I'm feeling so triggered by this. I was treated exactly like Cody as a child, albeit with no video evidence. I cannot begin to explain how much it affects you as a child, to be singled out and hated by your parents for no reason.",POSITIVE
Theres a special place in hell for those parents,NEGATIVE
why does the dad look like a walking time machine from 2001,NEGATIVE
The parents are getting off on abusing little Cody. It's a sickness. He's so cute too 😞,POSITIVE
I love j Aubrey’s intros,POSITIVE
You can't make videos blasting others for featuring scams and accept ad money from established titles...,NEGATIVE
"That poor little dude.... Those ""parents"" should be jailed.",NEGATIVE
"Remember watching him april 2017, always been a low life.",NEGATIVE
"Man this is hard to watch, how did they not see the damage they were causing. I wish I could have step into those moment and just given him a hug.",NEGATIVE
"6:37 My mom used the same punishment tactics on me when I was a child, and I was diagnosed with Cronic PTSD. Sadly, I am 49 now and I just started the healing process. Two things were different, 1- I had to write 1000 times not just 25 and 2- my mom didn't do pranks on she dragged me around the house by my hair.",NEGATIVE
at the sponsered segment i thought you were sponsered by scotland,NEGATIVE
A prank is FUNNY not just for the prankster it HAS TO BE FUNNY for the person that gets pranked cody was not laughing he was fucking traumatized.,NEGATIVE
This video starts out slapping hard,NEGATIVE
I'm now being dragged into the commentary content rabbit hole.,NEGATIVE
This is absolutely DISGUSTING. how was this ever a thing?!?!,NEGATIVE
I had never watched of this man's videos before and the clips I saw of the parents abusing Cody made me cry. No child deserves this.,NEGATIVE
I hope cody and emma sue there ass when the turn 18,NEGATIVE
I can only assume none of the target audience for these types of channels will ever watch this video. I can't understand the headspace for the audience for these types of channels.,NEGATIVE
"i was the scapegoat in my family and was abused psychologically and physically, and the footage of these kids’ abuse brings back a lot of painful memories. i feel horrible for Cody. that was me at that age. i can’t imagine what it would be like to have my abuse filmed and broadcasted as entertainment for a bunch of sadistic monsters.",POSITIVE
Cody was 1000% the family scapegoat. I pray he's healing and have faith that when he's grown and has kids of his own that he will be the dad he wished he had.,POSITIVE
WTF kind of parents would do this to their own children?!?!? Both of them should have gone to jail for child abuse.  Locked up for life!!!,NEGATIVE
These parents are evil forreal,NEGATIVE
"Fucking Baltimore County is one of the WORST police departments I have ever encountered. I lived in Baltimore county, I got jumped by a stranger, they told me the guy was getting locked up, went around the corner then let him out. I called the police dept to speak to the supervisor and also called Internal Affairs for them to tell me the body cam footage of every police officer was malfunctioning. How fucking ironic, huh??? They don’t want to work and they are just absolute shit. I knew somebody who has a warrant and the police knew, they didn’t locked him up because again, they didn’t want to do any paperwork. Don’t ever live in Baltimore county.",NEGATIVE
"I’m from Md, him being born in the city make sense on why he is the way he is.",POSITIVE
Whoever does your editing if you don’t they did an awesome fucking job at it!!!,POSITIVE
That poor child. I can’t imagine the feelings of diminishment and abandonment. They quite literally laugh while he weeps in distress. Heartbreaking.,NEGATIVE
This was one of the hardest watches of your videos. I hope the kid is doing alright.,POSITIVE
"Looks more stupid than funny having a dad like that .
Grow up dad",NEGATIVE
Anyone can be a parent. Not everyone deserves to be a parent.,POSITIVE
"This is horrible, ESPECIALLY for Cody, That boy and the rest of the kids DID NOT deserve what they went through.....Not at all.....
ALSO WHY WAS ONLY 2 OF THE 5 KIDS TAKEN AWAY?!? THEY ALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY!!!!!",NEGATIVE
that was a criminally good edit for a criminal family,POSITIVE
"Spraying invisible ink on the carpet as a prank, but they seemed to forget it's a prank, turned into screaming and verbally abusing the poor kid 😢",NEGATIVE
Established titles was a scam,NEGATIVE
That intro went hard,POSITIVE
"The fact that people see this family as highly abusive while real abusive families actually does these things 100x worse and do it way more for no real reason. This family has toys and at least decent communication outside the pranks. they don't beat their children, or starve them. these parents have bad behaviour and are clearly mean to their children but it's far from real abuse",NEGATIVE
Reminder that this man had an award shipped to him by YouTube for making videos about actual child abuse. Wtf YouTube.,NEGATIVE
"I can't finish this video. Love an exposè as much as the next guy. But after getting 15 minutes in, and reading the comments I don't want to know what he did to those kids. I have spent most of my life travelling the world, and as such have been disconnected from this kind of story. I settled with my wife in 2019 and we had our son. I can't imagine being cruel to my little guy. These animals have a special place in hell.",NEGATIVE
"The feces being spread is a HUGE sign of Cody being neglected and abused, kids who have behavioral issues like this tend to have come from homes where the child was physically and mentally abused. I hope Cody gets help and finds a home that loves him as much as we all do.",POSITIVE
They need to be in prison.   This is so abusive it’s incomprehensible,NEGATIVE
Why in the world did that judge reduce their probation,NEGATIVE
"My goodness, it’s awful what people do to children! God’s children are not your punching bags or your tools to emotionally manipulate in order to make money and gain fame!!",NEGATIVE
"I think you should've included the clips 27:17 because it's important to prove just how abusive that family was, you being ""uncomfortable"" isn't a good reason to not show them.",POSITIVE
"Only 2 kids were removed from their home? That's a fucking tragedy, wtf, why?? They abused all of them",NEGATIVE
"There is another,, one that goes by 8 Passengers.",NEGATIVE
"after 11 months of uploading, I would suggest Ruby Franke and her 8 Passengers channel to top this one or be pretty on par with daddyofive",POSITIVE
"Regardless of whether they call it a prank, they don’t like or live this child or any of there children. They are so disgusting! They are child abusers!",NEGATIVE
alright hes an asshole put you have to give him props hes a better person,POSITIVE
You don't articulate yourself as well Cody does and become that self aware at that age without suffering tremendous trauma,POSITIVE
"daddyOfive is the human defintion of ""its just a prank bro""",NEGATIVE
Remember back in the days when pranks were actually funny and harmless? Pepperridge farm remembers!,POSITIVE
That guy Mike looks like the dollar store version of General Zod,NEGATIVE
"What a disgusting excuse for parents.  My heart breaks for that poor kid.  I am still watching this video, only to find out if they are in jail.",NEGATIVE
Cody Deserves Better,NEGATIVE
Ive always thought the dad looked like the postal dude,NEGATIVE
Oh my God... these people are disgusting monsters. Some people don't truly deserve to be parents.,NEGATIVE
"I have barely made it 20 minutes in the video and I hope all these kids get help. The older ones are conditioned to just hate Cody as well. This is so sad, I really hope Cody gets help and learns this is not normal for kiddos.",NEGATIVE
24:10 broooo the fuck have you been doing go get yo kids dawg,NEGATIVE
I don’t know if I feel like watching anymore this scares me people like this exists 23:41,NEGATIVE
Even the Nigga that don’t love him came to his defence 23:03,POSITIVE
22:33 bro why,POSITIVE
"Great work on this vid.  You covered so much information.  We need YouTubers everywhere to notice and report these P.O.S. people that profit off of thier abuses towards others, especially children.  Thanks for all the work you put into this. Sad that the mental issues will stay with them, though they would do well to learn how to cope and live a happy life.",POSITIVE
"So this dude was a deadbeat dad from the moment they were born and then suddenly he started giving a shit? He used those poor kids as tools, never gave a shit and that cow he married, clearly didn't give af, not her kids anyway, and tortured those poor souls for some clicks. Some people should not be allowed to procreate. Being a parent is not for everyone.",NEGATIVE
That was a fucking fire intro,POSITIVE
"There's a difference with pranks.
1: Cover everything in present wrap. It's easy to clean, and amazingly funny. Not too annoying.

And then there's 2.
Acting like you shot your mate's dog.
That's bloody sadistic.",POSITIVE
"So Sentences is cruel wtf my parents busted my ass shit i wish i could write ""i will not steal from 7/11 "" 1000 times then what i got",NEGATIVE
"“Who (Cody) cries and cowers in fear, not even understanding what he’s been accused of”. That line right there shows how often Cody had gotten this kind of abuse. He was already crying and scared before even knowing what happened. He didn’t know that he did something wrong. He just knew that his parents were mad and they were blaming him, like always.",NEGATIVE
I honestly feel bad for Cody. Nobody should have to go through this and it's pissing me off.,NEGATIVE
Oh my god poor Cody,NEGATIVE
"I honestly think Cody is an absolutely adorable kid, and seeing him be treated this unfairly pisses me off to no end. Smh...",NEGATIVE
You don’t understand the sigh of relief that came out of my mouth when you said they were removed from the ‘family’,NEGATIVE
This is just sick.,NEGATIVE
Ruby Franke and this guy should be made to fight,NEGATIVE
Its always the worst type of people who have the most kids.,NEGATIVE
I just don’t get pranks in general. You put someone in a situation in which they have a reasonable response. Then you laugh at them for it. I don’t get it. It’s also straight bs to excuse any hurtful behavior with the words “it’s a joke”.,NEGATIVE
"WTF is wrong with these 2 parents?!?!? And with all the AHs watching this as ""entertainment""? These poor kids.",NEGATIVE
I hope the worst for Mike and Heather. Karma is a bitch and doesn't take prisoners.,NEGATIVE
Bro these parents are literally gaslighting cody wtf,NEGATIVE
Cody poor kid has ODD  and his dad and stepmom took advantage of his disability,NEGATIVE
"Now, lots of people don't know this but Heather had another baby recently.",POSITIVE
"Imagine hating on someone iver something that's literally none of your business, and also happened years ago🙄 crybabys",NEGATIVE
0:26 Mega Beatdrop,POSITIVE
I take solace in imagining the demonic pranks that these two will be subject to in hell.  What a bunch  of pieces of garbage!,NEGATIVE
Negative attention is still feeding this guys narcissistic personality. Everyone should stop,NEGATIVE
I'm glad the biological mother tryed to do soemthing about the situation,POSITIVE
Poor Cody 💔,NEGATIVE
"Established titles is a scam. It means nothing. Its complete BS. Public service announcement over

Have some consistency. If you claim to be about moral integrity, dont accept sponsers by these people.. jeez man. Lets make a video with fancy editing and ridiculous music (like in this video)  about your own accountability 


But yeah this family sucks",NEGATIVE
"7:15 I just realized how painfully ironic this is. Mike was usually quick to project this onto Cody, in one video he even berated him for shifting blame onto others, exclaiming “YOU are responsible for your actions, no one else!” (In a video entitled “Jake Crushes Cody”… nice name)

Fast forward to the breaking of the controversy and Mike, his wife, and now his eldest son Jake blame everyone else except themselves. It’s Defranco’s fault, it’s Nick Munroe’s fault, it’s the media’s fault. Mike is more of a child than his own son.",NEGATIVE
I hate them,NEGATIVE
"The one where they pretend to leave the kid in a mall broke my heart. That's the worst feeling for a kid! To feel that you are lost, or you've been abandoned. It breaks my heart when I see my dog like that in the park, when he loses sight of me, to intentionaly do that to a kid? Sick",NEGATIVE
"People who said Ryan’s parents use them for money




Me shows them this video",NEGATIVE
These parents created his behavior 😢!! Send that baby to me !! Disgusting 🤮,NEGATIVE
Wow 😮 I’ve never heard of them!! Horrible !!,NEGATIVE
The most toxic and most hated family of YouTube,NEGATIVE
The thumbnail is scary.,NEGATIVE
"This is a well made video don’t get me wrong, but could we have some kind of visual censoring at least? Some of the scenes were already to much because of the audio, and it’s just to much to see some of things happening to Cody. Otherwise, another well made video. Just please repost with some sort of visual censoring.",POSITIVE
"As someone who has dealt with both CPS and the police for child/domestic abuse? They aint going to do shit. Its not drugs. Its not a ticket.They cant profit off if.

Edit: realized im rewatching this horror shit show nearly a year later after my last comment. Christ.",NEGATIVE
People watching YouTube should report abuse early.,NEGATIVE
I know this is serious but why did the intro go so hard😭,POSITIVE
That’s how young adults un a life their parents.  Sick.,NEGATIVE
"I swear to god, Cody and his deadbeat dad are the real life equivalent to Peter and Meg in Family guy. An child abusive parent only doing it for his joy and The constant punching bag who acts more mature than anyone else in the family. Fucking disgraceful!!!!!",NEGATIVE
Oh my god he's a BABY. what is wrong with this people????,NEGATIVE
Can't call them parents. Parents don't psychologically and emotionally abuse their kids. The fact that the Baltimore Police refused to do anything is pathetic. Corporal punishment and abuse are very different. The whole situation is just terrible and I hope Cody is able to heal.,NEGATIVE
This brought me to tears. Mike is an abusive douche and has left him with serious psychological damage. He is a grade a arse. I hope Cody can find peace and happiness,NEGATIVE
"These parents are absolutely fucking terrible. I feel awful for all the kids, but especially for Cody.",NEGATIVE
Holy crap that intro was fire🔥,POSITIVE
"What worries me most is the ""fans"" of the content. It is basically violent voyeurism, and they like it. What does that say about them and what they do, or want to do, in their own lives?",NEGATIVE
"Cody, please know, you are loved! There is NOTHING wrong with who you are! I love you and so do other people! Don't ever think you're unloved, you've been raised and condition to think no one likes you and that no one wants you around. But that is SO far from the truth. You couldn't help your early life and who raised you and unfortunately you were raised by ppl (your own father which makes it hurt even more!) who made you feel unloved and unwanted and that is a LIE! Your brain was wired at such a young age and to rewire it, so to speak, is a long and exhausting process. Please know you are very lovable and wanted! Please try to find some peace. I know there's a battle in  your mind constantly due to your childhood, and I am so sorry for that. THEY are the unlovable, unwanted people. NOT YOU!",POSITIVE
"I call bull$hit on the commenter (  34:53 ) that said they were with cps.  Just by the use of, 'Even if the parents do it in the best of *attention*'",NEGATIVE
I just want five minutes in a locked room with these pos. I pray Cody is ok this had me sobbing😂,NEGATIVE
DaddyoFive was a real life Peter Griffin,NEGATIVE
Why those parents are not in jail,POSITIVE
"People need to learn from John & Kate Plus 8
That was in an Era when reality TV & having kids on TV wasnt as common as now & look how those kids turned out. 


The lengths ppl are willing to go for $$, fame & whatever is ridiculous. Do these ppl not look in the mirror & see how childish they are?! Smfh this is just sad, I pray for those kids.


God bless & protect In Jesus name",NEGATIVE
Ruby Franke just rose from the depths to challenge this video title.,POSITIVE
Making your kid write something over and over avain as a punishment isn't even that bad. People are getting soft.,NEGATIVE
Their channel is the definition of good plan horrible execution,NEGATIVE
How is there any humour on any of their pranks? Where the hell is any semblance of humour in any of their videos? It's essentially glorified child abuse,NEGATIVE
"That shit hit home hard for me because Mike reminded me too much of my own abusive dad. I know Mike watches videos about him so I hope he sees this comment. You're not only a garbage human, but I pray to whatever God exists karma hits you and your wife like the iceberg hit the Titanic. I also hope I see it just so I can go ""ItS JUst A pRaNK bRo!""",NEGATIVE
How the hell does the freaky thumbnail make them look better then they do irl,NEGATIVE
"As much as the parents are the perfect example of horrific parents, there is  massive blame on the 'followers' encouraging the behaviour. It shows just what's wrong with the world. Humanity is disgusting and broken.",NEGATIVE
Hearing the way that they talked about Cody just breaks my heart,NEGATIVE
"I HATE THESE PARENTS ABUSING YOUR CHILD FOR A VIDEO AND CALL IT A ""PRANK"" people are unbelievable.",NEGATIVE
"41:08
Worst channel so far",NEGATIVE
These people are cruel.,NEGATIVE
"23:24 
Even the other siblings are really upset.",NEGATIVE
"19:23 
This shit hurt my feelings so much. Poor Cody.",NEGATIVE
This was a hard watch omg. Not your content but the clips of just straight up abuse.,NEGATIVE
"I know we r all talking about how bad the parents are, but can we talk about the sick fucking veiwers who decided to watch them? And encouraged codys abuse? Shame on them!",NEGATIVE
"If a kid is going pink from being ""pranked"" they're not having fun they're being traumatised, I feel really sorry for Cody.",NEGATIVE
Truly horrible parents,NEGATIVE
Poor Cody 😢,NEGATIVE
"I remember seeing this years ago and i just wanted to give 
Cody the BIGGEST and warmest hug he's ever gotten... 
F*** those two ""parents""... I hope they live a LONG life full of sickness and misery...",POSITIVE
The easiest way to determine a fake is the excessively bad acting. It is the absolute dead give away that remains consistent,NEGATIVE
"The kids don't know when it's a "" *Prank* "" or it's Real. 
Especially Cody, so they're gonna be on edge 24/7",NEGATIVE
"Did they imprisson  these horrible parents❤i pray yes !,❤They gave goggle look to Cody   (makes me cry.",NEGATIVE
What the actual fuck,NEGATIVE
Hey. I make my kids write sentences. It's a good punishment. Not to be confused with abusing the punishment.,POSITIVE
Franke and Hildebrand have entered the chat.,POSITIVE
How did anyone even watch this and find it funny ? Poor Cody is gonna be mentally traumatised forever .,NEGATIVE
They are such cruel parents it is they only keep him for the  views,NEGATIVE
"Maaan i feel so bad for cody, they should rot in jail especially the mother, what a sad fucked human being she is.",NEGATIVE
This might not be a great time but what is this song called?,NEGATIVE
Gotta say that was a BANGER intro,POSITIVE
I wonder how Cody and Emma is doing today…,POSITIVE
#helpcodyandemma,POSITIVE
"I'm so happy that Cody and Emma are away from these terrible people, but it's so upsetting how broken the legal system is. Rose was the one who lost custody instead of these actual child abusers. I pray that the 3 remaining boys can eventually find some happiness and get away from these absolute monsters",NEGATIVE
Poor Cody,NEGATIVE
somebodies gonna end up in a retirement home..,NEGATIVE
"Congratulations your son is going to hate you for the rest of his life

And you deserve it",NEGATIVE
Yet another case of the courts/government failing it’s people. These people should of been locked up but instead get a slap on the wrist that got REDUCED as well.,NEGATIVE
"If I didn't hate the fact that little kids are loud and I also wasn't as anti social as I was, I would gladly adopt Cody as my brother.",POSITIVE
"This is heartbreaking to me to watch, my heart goes out to these kids my wishes that they can live with people that truly want children and love them how come get over the trauma that they were put through. And that this jackass of a guy gets put away because what he did was beyond wrong caused a lot of emotional problems for his kids. Anyone that enjoyed watching that obviously is  just as deranged as he is, I cannot believe that you tube would allow this to be on for the length of time that it was.
I would really like to know where these kids are today and and what happened with these so-called parents I'm really hoping that they were held to severe consequences for the damage they caused",NEGATIVE
I work in a store as the night shift where we stack shit on the shelves and sometimes I get a huge pile of product and I need to stand on my toes to get the top of the product down. Once there was some milk right at the top what no one had told me is that that milk was so rotten it had made a hole in the top of its carton. So what ended up happening was I picked it up and put it on its side to put it on my shoulder (because it was sever cartons of milk taped together so it was heavy) and it spilled. In my hair down my face on the inside of my mask down my cloths. It was disgusting and smelt so bad I just froze. Hearing that they poured rotten milk on the boy in the shower gave me flash backs like no other. Its genuinely horrible disgusting and it's just makes you stop functioning out of the WTF was that feeling!!,NEGATIVE
"*Throws Cody and causes him to get a bloody nose* 'Its just a prank Cody, stop being salty'. 

Its disgusting seeing parents put their youtube career before their children. Then ruthlessly abuse them, to show people online for money.",NEGATIVE
i can't help but feel sympathy for cody. to be the victim of your awful parents' abuse and have emotional trauma caused by it is truly horrifying. the fact people were even deranged enough to support mike's behavior towards his children is disturbing. i honestly hope that cody is doing better now and i really wish the best for him.,POSITIVE
Disgusting people everyone happily involved,POSITIVE
"Theres two ways to say daddyofive: ""Daddy O Five"" or ""Daddy of Five""",NEGATIVE
No man 😢💔,POSITIVE
Omg these parents are so so cruel! They don’t need kids period. Poor things. 😢😢,NEGATIVE
Born in 2005 like Emma. Which means she’s around 18 years old,POSITIVE
Now its 8 passengers 😂😂,POSITIVE
They don't love their kids. They love clout. They don't deserve to have custody of any of their children. They're unfit as parents and people. Those kids will need therapy for years. I hope they grow up to hate them and cut them out of their lives forever. I hope they can never get jobs or be accepted by anyone in society. Screw them,NEGATIVE
It's even scarier when the cameras are off and you have missed the mark that the mother is also a train wreck and that these children are going to be victims the rest of their lives and you are doing nothing to help them.....,NEGATIVE
Him saying “if you loved me you wouldn’t leave me” after most likely being told his mom left him by his dad is literally so heartbreaking!! Like what type of father does that to a kid… and the fact that the wife was a mom already and let this happen is psychotic asf 20:30,NEGATIVE
"I grew up in an emotionally unstable home due to my parents being emotional unaware of their own traumas. To this day, I still get triggered by yelling, arguing, and any aggressive behavior. I can only imagine how I would feel if my parents purposely did these things with a camera in my face and broadcasting for millions to see.",NEGATIVE
"I just stopped through to say, that opening song is a banger.",POSITIVE
This is out and out child abuse.,NEGATIVE
hearing the audio triggers something in me i don’t like,NEGATIVE
"Sad, poor Cody.   Wowzers, abusive parents. It's really hard to watch this.  Any disorders Cody had, were exacerbated by the pranks and dysfunctional parenting and family dynamics.  I have to stop watching, so sad 😢 Your videos are great! Sometimes just hard, I never got into family vlogging, etc channels.",NEGATIVE
These parents irritate me! My son has ADHD and signs of ODD. The way they treat cody saddens me. And the fact that people were encouraging the abuse is sickening.,NEGATIVE
"Daddy O' Five is a horrible parent and Heather is not an innocent mother, this family is horrible. Feel bad for the children especially Cody.",NEGATIVE
3:27 oh fuck you for sponsoring that shit,NEGATIVE
Established titles? That’s funny.,POSITIVE

"4:47 or 4:46  am I the only one who heard him say ""Help"" or did I missheard- (And then his face swallowed up and got very pink,that happends when you're about to cry and not letting it out)",NEGATIVE
CPS please save Cody. This is so wrong. I'm a step mom to two wonderful boys and our two kids. I would protect (all) our children and my husband would not be doing this shit. Who is protecting them them.,NEGATIVE
"That poor poor kid Cody - I’m beyond sickened, found that really hard to watch, it’ll probably haunt him throughout his life 😢",NEGATIVE
Imagine what this kid Cody is going through. He went to go stay with his dad for a while I'm sure his dad told him his mother doesn't want him anymore now hes stuck in this house where hes abused. He doesn't feel loved or supported by anyone. He's gonna have some problems when he grows up.💔,NEGATIVE
"These ""parents"" in jail right?",NEGATIVE
"You can tell Cody is a very intelligent child.  Unfortunately, they as failing parents did nothing to challenge, and stimulate him possibly could have helped curb some of his ODD.😢",NEGATIVE
are they still the worst YouTube family or does 8 passengers qualify for that role?,NEGATIVE
I hope these knuckleheads got arrested!! I've never wanted to punch two idiots more than I do right now.  OMG wow😮,NEGATIVE
they are worst than royalty family,NEGATIVE
Sorry but some people just stupid and should be made mind children and people watching and subscribe are as bad,NEGATIVE
"bro, i actually teared up at the invisible ink video, it reminded me of my own childhood, the difference being I was a bit older and my parents never said ""it's just a prank"". it's horrible that that's the only discernible difference. these people are horrible people with no morals. I can't imagine the kind of truma those kids went through and I hope they're in liveable conditions",NEGATIVE

THESE PARENTS HAVE TO BE ARRESTED,NEGATIVE
Damn they really treat that lil boy like shit for no reason.,NEGATIVE
This made me so physically sick…,NEGATIVE
"I think from the outside looking in a lot of people say ""i would never leave my child behind"" but none of us have had to deal with a child smearing feces on a wall in a public bathroom, screaming near a crowd, throwing things at strangers, crying in front of people, and probably if we did, we would just cancel the Disney trip, thus punishing every other child for the behaviour of one of them. So we can't really sit here and say ""why, I would never"" or ""that's so mean they didn't take him to Disney how dare they say nobody can stand him."" That child would have a horrible time there anyway.",NEGATIVE
Poor cody. Such a tragic childhood,NEGATIVE
Fucking monsters! I hope these kids get better carers,NEGATIVE
Established titles is a scam folks,NEGATIVE
"Those poor kids, seriously.   Who does this?  The dad reminds me of Micheal Barnett.... waste of skin.  This is SO horribly sad
  I never watch/ watched these family channels, it just seems wrong to me.  Yeah, if you love your kids and think everything they do is absolutely adorable you want to share.  This shit is going to far.  I wonder why YouTube lets this stuff bevposted.  You know there are so many channel trying to make people aware about these type of situations that can't post their vids for one reason or another.  Yet they allow clear child abuse with no problem??? Make it make sense.",NEGATIVE
That poor little boy! I hate most humans!,NEGATIVE

"Do the Martin Boys even regret what they did? I know they don't.
The entire book should've been thrown 10fold",NEGATIVE
God bless Phillip Defranco. The entire situation was escalating. The dad could have eventually killed his son. IDK why Mike wanted Cody and Emma. He CLEARLY hates them. Daddy’O Five is mentally unstable. “That DeFranco Guy” did him a favor by ending the situation and thank God!,POSITIVE

IM SORRY BUT THE MUSIC AT THE INTRO IS SO GOODD,POSITIVE
EVIL PARENTS,NEGATIVE
"Its unbelievable and so maddning that abusers with VIDEO PROFF of their abuse can go on to keep having kids and don't have cps on their door! Where the fuck is cps?! That's their job! They have all the proff they need!!

Its even more angering that they dont do shit with video proff but the fucked up system and some fucked up judge signed over custody with no proff of abuse!!

I can't belive they are still allowed to keep their kids and that youtube is doing nothing to take them down!? This system is FUCKED",NEGATIVE
It breaks my heart to see specifically Cody always in tears and with bruises on him all the time. These parents can rot in hell.,NEGATIVE
I don't get how anyone couldn't see how abused Cody was from the beginning.,NEGATIVE

I hope their fans lose everything and have to move in witha abusive family,NEGATIVE
Omg poor Cody. I want to hug him and tell him that parents shouldn’t be like this. He deserves love and safety,NEGATIVE
Bruh I actually liked their vlogs,POSITIVE
banger intro,POSITIVE
"I came across this bloke a while ago. Horrible dad. I don't know what is worse, the abuse the child suffered, the length of time that the dad was allowed to get away with it, or the fact that he documented it online and still no one did anything about it for ages... Children aren't properly protected even when abuse is made public.",NEGATIVE
The intro was superb👌🏽,POSITIVE
I thought it is old video. Because your sponsor here is established titles,NEGATIVE

Every kid deserves a parent not every parent deserves a kid,POSITIVE
I've never heard of these people before so I'm watching this and see what went on I'm sure I'm not going to like it.,NEGATIVE
Cody deserves a chance for his teenhood to be better than his horrific childhood. Those parents need jail for life for exploitation and emotional AND sometimes physical abuse and shit,NEGATIVE
I love daddyofive and his videos ❤❤,POSITIVE
That’s so sad for the kids those parents don’t need children in their care,NEGATIVE
This is AWFUL. Oh my god. That poor baby!!!,NEGATIVE
The way how these parents abused Cody is how serial killers and psycopaths are made,NEGATIVE
"These people aren't parents. They're monsters. At best, they're maniacs. I'm no parent, but I hate them, and their 'parenting' decisions give catastrophic results to their kids.",NEGATIVE
His face when you said you think i did this broke my heart you could tell he didnt do it and i dont see how people would even want to watch kids being abused this isnt funny i swear those two need there ass kicked for the way they treated the kids if i was the biological mother i would have beat her ass and his ass period,NEGATIVE
"J, I love you, but please drop Established Titles.",NEGATIVE
These two people are absolutely evil. I pray god protects their remaining children. I pray they repent of their sins and release their demons unto god and not unto their poor babies… I pray this is Jesus name… amen,NEGATIVE
Established titles is a scam,NEGATIVE
"These ""parents"" should be locked up.
These kids were abused, manipulated, and gaslighted. Cody endured all the abuse and the ""parents"" were extremely ableist by ""joking"" about sending him to military camps to correct behavior that he cannot control and wasn't being treated for.
The older boys constantly chiming in and being bratty by joining in on their parents behavior is very concerning because that tells me that these kids are going to grow up and treat their kids the same way.
The abuse is so obvious here and it really sickens me that people genuinely rooted for this; and it makes me sad to see how many people genuinely hated Cody for ""bad behavior""... he's a fucking child, he's traumatized, he has ODD, and you never know if he could have ADHD or hell, maybe even autism, or some type of learning disability. That child is not neurotypical and clearly needed some form of help, but instead, he was being verbally abused, physically abused, manipulated, gaslighted, and he was clearly being treated like shit by most of his siblings too. I hope all these kids grow up, realize what they went through was wrong, get the help they need, and never repeat what happened to them.",NEGATIVE
Intro is fire,POSITIVE

"I'm so happy the kids got adopted by other parents, that are more kind.",POSITIVE
"This makes me SICK, and the fact that the fans wanted it to continue and to get worse is horrible. I'm glad Cody got out of there bc I'm afraid that if he didn't.he would have eventually become unresponsive to the abuse, I died when he said ""let me guess, you think I did this"" and ""this is so Messed up"" those sentences alone tell you that he was aware that this wasn't ok.",NEGATIVE

Thinking you own a piece of land with a title lol 😂
Just send me your money and you can be a king or queen lol",NEGATIVE
Honestly I feel Cody my parents aren’t terrible my friends are the bad ones,POSITIVE
"26:06 Cody doesn't have""ODD""!! It is a 100% fabricated disorder! It stands for ""Oppositional Defiant Disorder"", which just means he's a normal little boy and not a mindless (yes sir no sir) drone. They tried to claim I had this when I was younger but, really it was just that I didn't care to listen to what dumb people had to say. I still don't! I can't stand the absolute snake oil the American psychological association attempts to manifest into being with a few corrupted and biased reports. 
PS. It's all in an attempt to create a subservient worker class out of the kids in the American education system.. btw. More cogs for the machine before they're drafted into an even deadlier machine to be used as canon fodder for the rich. 
ODD my ASS!! 😡",NEGATIVE
It’s so sad seeing everyone mock him online before. I feel so bad for the poor boy. 😢,POSITIVE

"him being abusive with discipline makes all the yelling and physical activity like banging on a door traumatic

there is no such thing as funny or excited yelling when you are a child of abuse",NEGATIVE
These people need to be thrown in jail and have fake records as S O’s and let them beat them to a pulp and then let Cody come in and be like….PRANk!!!,NEGATIVE
"This is one of the most fucked up things I have ever seen.
This is a PTSD machine. Imagine destroying someone else's property and then having cadre of authority people scream at that person, that would be fucked up for an adult who has the emotional maturity to know they did nothing wrong and that whether people believe them or not they did not do anything wrong and eventually it will pass.
Kids don't have that. They need their parents to provide stability and guidance so the kids lack of maturity does not become a paint mixing machine of emotional distress.",NEGATIVE
I hate them so much... but GODDAMN THAT INTRO WAS FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,NEGATIVE
If I was in Cody shoes I would have been happy to be put up to adoption,NEGATIVE
"The mom's cackle after the disappearing ink ""prank"" just sounded evil.",NEGATIVE
"Okay first thing, Rose wasn't trying to give Mike a ""2nd chance"" at being a father, she needed help with that boys DOD. And second who sends their kid somewhere for the summer and that doesn't question why he hasn't been home until December?
I think they both are shit parents

S*** this video just gets deeper. Unfortunately, if you guys listen to what J says about roses explanation about losing the kids, there's a lot of holes and you could hear in her hesitation every time she mentions losing the kids she stops herself because she isn't fit to be a mother either. Just like Mike isn't fit to be a father",NEGATIVE
"I hope Cody is ok, this is horrible",NEGATIVE
looks like youtube red room,NEGATIVE
I subscribed just from the intro,POSITIVE
these monsters should be in jail,NEGATIVE
"No one’s gonna bring up that the Baltimore police looked at this blatant abuse and said “No that’s fine, he can still have the kids we don’t need to intervene.” ‘Corporal punishment’ my ass! They just didn’t want to bother helping these kids out!",NEGATIVE
The fact that they threw a bean bag at him is child abuse.,NEGATIVE

"A few more years of these kids with them, I won't be surpised if this family ends up in a true crime channel, with Cody st*bbing everyone.",NEGATIVE
"I'm not sure if anyone else caught this, but in one of the comments where someone is telling the dad to hit Cody, their username contains the word ""shouta"" aka the sexualization of minor boys. That is definitely not a coincidence. They are sexualizing the kids being abused like that. It's so sick and twisted, I feel nauseous.",NEGATIVE
NOOOO NOT ESTABLISHED TITLES,NEGATIVE
The fact people cheered this on is soo disgusting.,NEGATIVE
That intro goes hard,POSITIVE
i have to turn this video off after seeing the first clip of cody getting his xbox destroyed while his dad screams like a lunatic. What a demented twisted person to do that. I hope he never gets a relationship with his kids and they heal from the abuse they suffered ❤,NEGATIVE
"You know that Scotland tree thing???? It was just discovered months ago that it was fake and whenever people showed up to their “plots of land” they were realizing 1. That they can’t even get to their plot without some very challenging few hour hikes, some more or way less them others but STILL….. 2. People were still showing up to these plots that they “bought” and finding that their plots, the things that should display of their family name, nor have an actual plot dignifying that this is your land….. 3. The MOST controversial of ALL OF THESE is that….drum rolls please….. that these plots of land WERE ALREADY FUCKING OWNED by land owners who’ve owned it for many years even generations in these landowners family name!",NEGATIVE

What awful parents,NEGATIVE
Cody being the youngest son and being probably the most mature out of everyone that was in their house is really saddening. I hope he's doing better now.,NEGATIVE
i am surprised one of these kids didn't just get fed up with all the abuse and pull a knife on this asshole father,NEGATIVE
I really hope there kids hate them when they get older. Poor Cody it's not okay to treat a child that way. Oh man I had to stop watching this cause I would love to meet that Dad IRL I could show him some pranks,NEGATIVE
"I wish CPS would take them kids. They don't get to choose there parents. At the end of the they are bully's nothing more. POS so called ""parents"" He talks about having issues. But at what point do you as an adult make your own choices? The choice they made was to bully there kids. I really hope CPS takes them away them kids deserve way better. No kid should have to deal with that in there own home. There life is full of shit people in there life at school and outside of the home. They shouldn't have to deal with it at home too. This is why young people take there own life's.HMMMMM I wounder why that kid has ODD SMH FFS Very sad.",NEGATIVE

"I know the community guidelines say keep the comments respectful. But fuck those piece of shit garbage disgusting cunt people, I hope they get life in prison.

Comming from someone who's mentality ill, I don't even want to imagine the amount of trust issues, trauma and depression the kids, especially Cody, got from this. I hope the children get the therapy the need and those pieces of shit get a prison sentence and therapy for their clearly fucked up metal state.

I hope I didn't upset anyone with my frasing, I just can't stand things like this <3",NEGATIVE

You have to write sentences in school a billion and 2 times... Is the school system abusive?

I can only imagine how cody feels, in all the vodeos he NEVER wanted to leave the family! And now the family is no longer a family its crazy, i truly hope him and emma are happy and found peace",NEGATIVE

You people are insane. They are not hurting the kids therapist and you people are. Videos shouldn't be online for the world to see in my opinion but its just that my opinion. Its their kids and none of your buisness how they raise them. Cases like this are why children die everyday. Kids actually getting abused get no help because the state is focused on this shit. You people are pathetic,NEGATIVE
I agree with you man I feel so bad for those kids.. Especially Cody and Emma they didn’t deserve to be treated by them…,NEGATIVE
"I think the worst part about this is, at the end of the day, even if Cody and Emma are gone..... they're still getting away with it and we've turned a blind eye because the tea has moved on to a different asshole of the week. They still have a youtube channel, two in fact. They're still profiting off of the suffering of their children, they still have their stans, and at the end of the day youtube would've let it continue forever and ever unless the news hadn't gotten involved.",NEGATIVE
"Im suprised when Cody was without his parents in some way, im suprised he didnt celebrate.",NEGATIVE
CODY IS FUKING KID AND CODY IS PROBABLY GOING TO HAVE TRUST ISSUES!!!,NEGATIVE
"I come from a household where I always heard screaming and things, just watching this is so hard to watch it physically hurts me to watch. Those parents are absolutely disgusting and horrible. I hope Cody gets or has gotten help...",NEGATIVE
the fact youtube never took the videos' down is disgusting,NEGATIVE
This breaks my heart 😩😭,NEGATIVE
My dad purposefully hid from me in crowded public settings multiple times at a very young age because he thought it was funny. The experience traumatized me severely and I still work on it in therapy to this day. I'm 31. This is abuse.,NEGATIVE
"My brother has autism, ADHD, and ODD, so to see the abuse to Cody leaves me heartbroken…I hope he’s doing better now….",NEGATIVE
"What the hell, how could these people live with themselves after psychologically torturing that little boy like that.",NEGATIVE
Child protective services NEED TO BE CALLED! This is what unfit parenting looks like.,NEGATIVE
"The invisible ink scene is disturbingly similar to the incident that occurred between Leticia Stauch and Gannon Stauch right before she murdered her stepson: she was mad that Gannon had spilled a substance and they would have to sell their stuff to pay off the landlord and not get kicked out. The videos are so similar, I almost thought this daddy of five vid was playing when I was watching that case. The dehumanizing abuse and valuing objects over children is the same",POSITIVE
I can’t and won’t watch more of this video after the 23 minute stamps because holy shit. This is incredibly sad. That kid is going to be fucked up when he grows up all because his parents are retards,NEGATIVE
24:54 it’s considered corporal punishment so police did……nothing…huh!!?,NEGATIVE
Were they all 12 years old in the house cause huh?!,NEGATIVE
Cody if you ever read this   As a father with two good young boys who are 15 and 12    We would rather have you with us then any of those other punk step brothers of yours   They're the losers     What a disgusting father and piece of shit mother,NEGATIVE
Y’all soft lol,NEGATIVE
"It definitely sounds like Rose gave Cody up and is using this to put all the blame on Daddy of Five guy, she is full of crap. Custody papers like that would likely need signed in front of a judge, lawyer or even notory. Regardless, im just saying she likely gave up her kids willingly, ogherwise, why did she not persue custody or legal justice for them forging her signature? They are definitely crazy people, I am not saying they're not. But if you are afraid of these people yourself, you really think their house is the best place for your kids? Regardless, there are other nearby towns, but conflict of interest only works so much. I dont know about Emma, but sounds like she willingly gave Cody to his father. Of courde she feels guilty now, but i dont think the fear card is the best option if you're looking for sympathy.",NEGATIVE
"It seems like you're just using the kids abuse to capitize just as much as the parent's, really. Clearly you're not the abuser, but this is going to follow these kids their entire lives, and you're not helping. It's sad.",NEGATIVE
"i actually feel so so so bad for them, especially Cody. none of those kids deserve that but it’s actually so sad.",NEGATIVE
I found out about these people via DeFrancos videos. Good on him for perusing this relentlessly. These people are gross. I hope Cody gets the therapy and suppport he needs and sues his dad for back pay from the channel.,NEGATIVE
"Can we talk about Cody going ""I don't even know what that 'traumatized' even means."" He shouldn't have a bullshit meter this young in life...",NEGATIVE
Now he's DaddyofNone,NEGATIVE
"There are far worse parents out there then this, my parents for 1 were worse, and there far worse parents then what i had, you just never seen it on YouTube because they hide behind cameras and behind closed doors, because basically all abusers are liars and cover it up.",NEGATIVE
Wow that’s awful this is typical narcissistic parenting. Soooo scary,NEGATIVE
bro made the parents look like creepy pastas 💀,NEGATIVE
Ooof might wanna get rid of that first ad 😅,POSITIVE
That intro Hittin harder than daddy of five hitting Cody🔥🔥🔥🔥,POSITIVE
i couldn’t even finish the video it made me so uncomfortable,NEGATIVE
I got to say the beginning of the video slaps,NEGATIVE
"I hope that these... I can't even call them human beings, they are fucking parasites who can't do anything other than abuse their children because they got nothing else going on in their pathetic lives. I hope that they game end in the most agonizing way possible, I also pray to god that there is an afterlife so they can suffer for all eternity. Also I've had a much more pleasant leg infection than whoever calls themselves daddyofive fans. 
Also I have to clarify that I do not wish to harm or threaten anyone, these are simply my thoughts on the matter.",NEGATIVE
I am so glad I don’t watch all DaddyOfFive videos as a child. I hated how they treated their kids that way. Not only they never cared about them.,NEGATIVE
I just hated how the parents mistreated their kids because of the pranks they had ever done. Not only they could neglect their kids. It’s awful.,NEGATIVE
Oh my god that was really hard to watch that poor kid,NEGATIVE
"I'd love to find those POS who thought it was funny that poor boy and girl were being abused and do all the things  that were done to those poor kids to them also that ""dad"" needs his legs broken and left in the middle of a crowd laughing at him and throwing things at him as cameras shoved in his face! I hope Cody has a good life poor kid. And the fact the kids in that one video were just sitting watching to me tells they were scared to say something the oldest kid also is a little shit.",NEGATIVE
All for some views and likes. These people are sick……..period.,NEGATIVE
Brooo this needs an update jake nows a rapper going by baby don 🧐🧐,NEGATIVE
"Apparently i didn’t havea pulse in 2017, I've never heard of these people",NEGATIVE
"Poor Cody you could hear him mutter under his breath “it’s just a prank“even he was done with his parents, bullshit at such a young age",NEGATIVE
"Tiny Tw: child abuse / neglect 

When I was younger I was the ""Cody"" of my household. Starting the age of about 3 or 4, i was abused and neglected until i was removed from my parents custody at 12 yrs old. Watching these videos makes me genuinely sick to my stomach. That poor boy has been through so much. Knowing I (to an extent) know what he's gone through first hand sends chills down my spine. I hope he's doing well now.",POSITIVE
We’re seriously still doing the established titles bs?,NEGATIVE
these poor kids...,NEGATIVE
I'm not sure if I can watch the rest of this after this Cody stuff started. No kid should be made to feel that way. And the way a child acts as a direct result of their environment. Look what you're doing to the kid. And you're doing it for money and recognition. I swear some people should be sterilized the second thing display behavior like that,NEGATIVE
"Jesus, this family is messed up. Doing shit then blaming him, these parents should be in prison. This kid is gonna turn out to be a murderer or a terrible person.",NEGATIVE
It’s insane that people like watching a young boy suffer without even realizing what they’re even saying.,NEGATIVE
"Fuck, I can't believe these sickos live less than half an hour from me",NEGATIVE
what is the song in the intro called?,POSITIVE
what is the song called?,POSITIVE
"Saying that the guy used cruel punishments, but then showing a kid writing 25 simple sentences was pretty funny.

Maybe should've shown the actual cruel actions. They were plenty. I do not think Cody will ever be able to recover, especially if he does have ODD.",NEGATIVE
Uh established titles is quite a scam but love the insight on DaddyOFive,POSITIVE
16:54 mike sounds like hes about to faint here,NEGATIVE
Well that ad didn't age well.,NEGATIVE
"This is more messed up than what Blocky does and it's literally an animated series- jeez-
These parents are horrible",NEGATIVE
"The fact that these ""parents"" who were abusive and told a ton of lies just to have kids to abuse under their belt, while at first the justice system bats an eye and takes their side? Sickening..",NEGATIVE
"Is no one gonna talk about how Established Titles, a complete scam, is sponsoring this video?",NEGATIVE
"I feel so bad for cody and emma. Poor kids, they didnt deserve that. I hope theyre okay.",NEGATIVE
"""arishem the judge is typing""",NEGATIVE
"I have never been happier that children were taken away from someone. They were being abused mentally, and even in some cases (with the bookshelf, which is absolutely DISGUSTING) psychically. Being told it's always their fault, and that they were the main cause of all the problems, as seen with Cody. He was being broken down and tormented for some internet likes and clout. I was so happy that Emma and Cody were finally taken away and put in the care of a loving mother finally.",POSITIVE
Cody sounds more like an adult when he speaks than the actual adults,NEGATIVE
"I’m all for parents have sovereignty over how they raise their children but some stuff is ridiculous…By the way, you may want to do some research on Established Titles…",NEGATIVE
Established Title is a scam. I know sponsorships help you keep your chanel running but I think you should be mindful of what you promote.,NEGATIVE
Established titles is a scam.,NEGATIVE
i really think cody would become a school shooter and i would not blame him this is fucked up,NEGATIVE
for anyone wondering. established titles is a scam,NEGATIVE
If it was enough views theyd kill that child,NEGATIVE
Abuse comes in many forms not just physical,POSITIVE
"Oh no, they had to write……if it gets worse alright but that’s not a bad punishment……it’s what teachers made you do….. i have watched the rest of the video yet so I’m holding off on my overall conclusion until then but writing down something over and over isn’t abuse or abnormal, in fact it’s a decent way to discipline your child without becoming physical. Your children need discipline people, they require it to be functional adults, if you do not give them discipline they will turn on you one day and eventually become spoiled adults. Like we see so much nowadays.",POSITIVE
These parents are sick in the head.,NEGATIVE
just seeing these clips are horrifying,NEGATIVE
That's an awesome intro but Daddy or five is just making children go through alot and making them think the baddest thing in their life while he is laughing  clearly just the bitchiest parents a kid could have,NEGATIVE
"They should have been put in prison, that’s blatant child abuse!",NEGATIVE
Who here after established titles got exposed...,NEGATIVE
"Imagine being so obsessed with getting internet views that you abuse your own child for a video, depressing",NEGATIVE
Its sicken to see such horrible parents.,NEGATIVE
"what sick parents I would literally leave the house and move to my grandparents if these were my parents, at least they wouldn't be corrupted by clout.",NEGATIVE
"I can’t even watch the clips, these poor babies :(",NEGATIVE
I hope the kids are doing better. And the **parents** get put in jail for their actions. Anyone who doesn’t that to their kid don’t deserve to have kids.,NEGATIVE
20:39 ultra instinct Cody,POSITIVE
Dude need too take out the ad on here's video,NEGATIVE
Oh no... Stablish scamers sponsor,NEGATIVE
good god some of these videos are just sickening. they really make me flash back and think about my brother and I being screamed at by our dad and how terrifying living in that house was.,POSITIVE
"The ""The Martin Family"" channel uploaded a new video Titled 
""THE TRUTH (part 1)""",POSITIVE
I'm glad they're back in the care of a loving parent. It's sad when the ex marries someone or cheats with someone ugly compared to the one he had before (Rose) that is beautiful on the inside and out. But i guess because he's abusive he picked someone as abusive as himself and they decided to keep the youngest as a means of taunting and treating the kids as punching bags.,POSITIVE
Honestly I relate to Cody ny self as far as my own childhood goez,POSITIVE
that intro goes hard,POSITIVE
"The biggest bullshit here is the fact that these people (I won't call them ""parents"" because they aren't) had subscribers and people who cheered on this stuff, especially bullying Cody. All of those people suddenly turned on the people, but are of course never held to account for their own involvement in escalating any of this crap.",NEGATIVE
Stares violently.🎉,NEGATIVE
"That boy better sue those adults for emotional damages for the therapy and probable medications he’s gonna have to take. These aren’t pranks, this is bullying. I get some people are over sensitive but when no one is laughing it’s definitely not a joke.",NEGATIVE
"Rose is the original abuser and is the devil compared to these two, ANYONE WHO DOESNT REALIZE THAT IS GULLIBLE THEY MADE YALL THINK BIO MOM WAS ANY BETTER YALL JUST JUMPED ON THE BANDWAGON AND CANCEL CULTURE TRAIN YOU GULLIBLE NERDS",NEGATIVE
4:45 is just sad ESPECIALLY hearing from their most targeted victim in the family 😢 edit: the one with the glasses is named Cody he was the one the most abused 💔💔💔,NEGATIVE
"I’m actually nauseous from watching this. I don’t know how I feel about having kids myself, but I sure as hell would not EVER let myself act like this towards my own kids. This guy isn’t acting like a dad. He’s acting like a bigger kid picking on a younger one because he thinks it’s funny, without realizing it just makes him look pathetic. He doesn’t even speak like an adult, just an overgrown sixth grader.",NEGATIVE
Do only I feel sorry for  this Cody-boy?  This father-o-figure deserve the Worst Father rEWARD,NEGATIVE
"This nearly brought me to tears, i feel so bad for these kids, straight torture",POSITIVE
i dont really know what that means but no,NEGATIVE
Since they lied to police they should get life sentences since they abused those kids from day one fuck them and everyone who fucking helped them and all the lawyers who LISENED TO THE CHILD ABUSERS. If they had brains they'd know not to allow such things its literally illegal sabotage.,NEGATIVE
"Send them abusers to prison. They can study on big kid pranks. When they get beat/molested/physically owned by someone there who hates child abusers they can remember, they're just playing lol it's just a prank, your stabbed out eye will be fine lolz. Getting abused in prison is something you can't escape. Might be locked in a room with the same person for months or years being a victim of these fun antics these quirky criminals have to offer and no there ain't no cameras to document shit so half the time anyone who'd care to help wouldn't know what was going on.",NEGATIVE
*Established Titles* is a misleading scam.,NEGATIVE
This family always gave me bad vibes. I always felt horrible for the children in this cluster fu<k of a family.,NEGATIVE
His laugh is the very definition of peaked-at-highschool-asshole,NEGATIVE
"these parents dont realize they targeted shit in children that can make them scared for their damn life, like breaking stuff in front of them with that hammer makes children think they could possibly be hurt or even killed because of their outrage and stressing them out like that could literally kill them im disappointed but the oldest is smart to manipulate the father to get an ok relationship by playing along with their twisted shit, children are smart and can manipulate their parents and other people to get what they want if it is going to be their last result like that one 8 year old who was able to manipulate her capture into letting her live and get him in prizon even when she watched her own brother die to the hands od her capture and able to wedge her way out of being strangled by her capture",NEGATIVE
"Hearing the dad’s laugh after he says its a prank, is absolutely TERRIFYING. I’d hate to hear his laugh ever again.",NEGATIVE
Anybody who commits child abuse should automatically get the death penalty,NEGATIVE
"I'd never heard of Daddy of 5. I went and found a full version of the ink video and now I'm crying. It's so sad to me that these parents did so much to hurt their kids during the most precious time of life. This literally was their childhoods. The parents scream, swear, and threaten as they gaslight their traumatized son, then punish the other son for trying to protect his little brother. These kids are young and they can't do anything to fight back or protect themselves. 😢😢😢",POSITIVE
"people who were ""hungry"" for that content are psychos and be in jail right away unless its people like j aubrey and others that is spreading this news",NEGATIVE
One thing he hasn’t said is that some of the videos are still on YouTube inside the channel of “daddyOArchive,NEGATIVE
"Other than this video, I’m so glad I’ve never heard of that shitbag channel before",NEGATIVE
This guy is lucky his YouTube is gone.,NEGATIVE
20:40 pranks are funny. This kid needs cps to step in. Wtf!!! This isn’t a family. That man child doesn’t deserve Cody.,NEGATIVE

I just found out that Cody is only a few months older than me. I wonder if he’s ok now.,POSITIVE
"Cody seems to have really mature reactions to these ""pranks"" considering he's an emotionally abused child. ""That's messed up"" The kid understands that but somehow the rest of the family does not.",POSITIVE

This whole situation is unacceptable child abuse. The family don't deserve to have Cody.   B'STARDS!!!!,NEGATIVE
Adults who traumatize children are turning them into adults with mental health issues.,NEGATIVE
"oh my god i've heard about so many true crime cases involving kids that always *disturb* me but the clips in this made me actually cry. the whole thing is so disgusting. not just the videos themselves, but the fact that this mental TORTURE was broadcasted and celebrated and made fun of for years, fully in public, just makes it that much worse. i really don't know how anyone could watch these """"""pranks"""""" and think they were funny",NEGATIVE

Not that Banger intro tho,NEGATIVE
"Soooooo glad I was able to get through watching this disgusting child abuse I think I've seen so far because especially Cody needed to be taken out of that house asap!!!! To the Mum of Cody and Emma(hope I got that right) congratulations on getting your children back, I think your amazing because you didn't let them beat you down you stood your ground and now your children are free to enjoy life with a stable, loving and calm home ❤️ I'd like to add to the adult abusers you both should have spent time in prison 🤬🤬",POSITIVE
"I Hope these two get what they deserve and the kids all get help. This is just heartbreaking, and you know this guy got picked on his whole life and he takes it out on his kids. Gross.",NEGATIVE
25:09 Look how he grabs Emma by the FUCKING NECK. That his messed up shit. I hope those parents burn in hell.,NEGATIVE
"Really late to this but this is just extremely messed up. The fact that Cody himself says that says a lot. 

The kids in the family that were affected by this deserves an apology from their parents and the fans who actually enjoyed seeing them get abused.",NEGATIVE
The DC universe disowns this abusive family and adopts Cody as Robin before he turns into joker,NEGATIVE

"The step ""mom"" checks the trailer trash fat woman stereotype I i grew up with so much.",POSITIVE
Anything for money huh,NEGATIVE
People can be FUCKING monsters sometimes,NEGATIVE
"I am happy Cody and Emma was taken from this situation, with the way the pranks was progressing there was a possibility that the children could have been severely hurt or worse. In regards to the three remaining children, I agree with that CPS agent that said that they are promotion child abuse. These boys have grown up in an environment where abuse is seen as funny or a prank. There is a likelihood that they will also become abusers when they have children as well. I really hope the 3 boys got help some how and are able to cope with the trauma that they experienced.",POSITIVE

The prank:",NEGATIVE
"Honestly, I feel only a little sympathetic. But I've seen and been through worse. I know for a fact I havem't experienced the worst of it, but these kids definitely haven't. 

He says normal life seems out of reach. But I've never even had a normal life. Being locked away at 6 years old all the way to 16 and having no family. Constantly moving to placements where kids were your worst enemy. Staff that didn't care to stop them from harming you. 

Yeah, I feel bad that they went through that, but I guess when you've experienced worse, you don't feel as sympathetic. I mean, I never met my real parents. All I knew at 5 years old was my parents hated me and my biological mother burned me at 2 years old. 

I may seem like a jerk for saying that. The parents are horrible for doing that, but I guess no one can force themselves to feel a certain way. 

I relate more with other animals than I ever do with humans. I grew to hate my own kind to the point if they got ripped apart limb from limb, I'd just feel bad, shrug and move on. I think animals got the worst of it in total. But I've been locked away, treated like dirt, used to make money, and bought by people just like other animals. 

Again, I know I seem like a jerk, but the bright side is there's people who feel more passionate for these kids than I do. And I feel more sympathy for other animals than my own species. A trade off I guess.",NEGATIVE

The parents too, like their child has some behaviour disorder, they still gonna prank him and made his life miserable. Police and judges are so fucking stupid in these, u cant trust them when they are soo easily bribed",NEGATIVE
"I'm sorry but I couldn't watch your whole video. I could only stomach 15 mins of it. I was so triggered and appalled that these parents would do that to these children. This is straight up child abuse that would make these poor children have mental breakdown which could lead to suicide.
WTF is wrong with the parents and the viewers?!?!? 🖕Daddyofive🖕",NEGATIVE
These two didn't deserve to have any children. So awful...,NEGATIVE

"I'm not excusing any of his appalling actions, but I can't help but think the father must have had an appalling childhood himself.",NEGATIVE
"I ain't believing a word that comes out of Rose's mouth. There are hundreds of thousands of attorneys out there, you can't say she couldn't find one confidentially and do a phone visit and explain that she was going to retain that person before her ex could find out who it is and try to sabotage it. And I don't believe her signature was forged that many times. You can tell Heather didn't give too s**** about Rose. Or her kids. There's no way she would go out of her way to take two kids that she really didn't give a damn about. She willingly let her kids go for whatever reason. None of us should be buying it and she has no business trying to sell it. Wherever those two kids landed, I hope they're able to emotionally and mentally recover.",NEGATIVE
You can tell in the videos of Cody that hes forced himself to mature to the point where he understands whats happening at a age where he shouldn't even know what this kind of shit is. These people are disgusting and cant take care of someone with very clear mental illnesses who NEEDS that extra help and instead end up traumatizing him for YEARS. I dont think Cody will ever see this but if he does I hope he knows its not his fault and he didnt deserve this treatment I hope hes doing better now,NEGATIVE

Please alert your viewers to this",NEGATIVE
"Its amazing that he still has fans, even when presented with evidence of why this is wrong, of why this is abuse. The people who like this lack empathy and are emotionally immature. They will believe anything told to them since its just a prank, just a threat in minecraft, just a meme not an endorsement of misogyny or racism. It's a comfort to know that regardless of how hard he will push to get back his fame back this is his legacy, a child abuser.",NEGATIVE

As someone who has been abusive in multiple ways by my biological father this makes my blood boil not that the dad LIED to THE LAW and hurt his kid then said it wasn’t abusive is disgusting.

jsut watched that again made me remember seeing the channel at that time sad it took so long for them to be exposed and hopefully they didnt do anythign worse...  they literally did what everyone warns people about hollywood... same thing abused chidlren for fame and money... idc if they really understand what theyre doing to their children... they msut live under the impression its normal to grow up like this... esp since mostly everyone has a channel by now... u can only gues the damage this channel did to naive people watching this normalizing childabuse for the corparate/socalled elite pedos... also they constantly mocked the biologicalmother by showing her how they abuse her children. those people need to be put in prison as soon as their children are old enough to support themselves...,NEGATIVE
The fact they kept custody of the other 3 boys is infuriating.,NEGATIVE
Hey guys today we’re going to verbally abuse our son and then humiliate him by posting a video of him sobbing to share with millions of people on the internet 😜,NEGATIVE
Joey salad was real especially that men vs woman S.A,POSITIVE
This is so disturbing. Equally disturbing is the fact that this video has gotten so many dislikes. It alarms me how many fans this creep had and that many still defend him.,NEGATIVE
Everyone needs to see the video of Cody at a parade with Rose and her boyfriend. The situation Cody is in now is arguably worse than before,NEGATIVE
this made me appreciate my (normal) parents even more,POSITIVE
Dude wtaf hope Cody lives happily ever after. SMH,POSITIVE
anyone who liked DaddyoFive needs help and should be banned from being near kids...,NEGATIVE
What was the song in the intro,POSITIVE
"As someone with adhd and odd, the fact that these abusers tried to claim Cody’s e reaction as fake makes me sick to my stomach, I see my own reactions to abuse in him. These parents don’t deserve to breath air",NEGATIVE
Intro is fire 🔥 🔥 🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️,POSITIVE
Jesus they let look Family Guy like a wholesome Family Sitcoms from the 80's,NEGATIVE

And types of toys 
And get all those for him
Get him a nice warm blanket
Get him some fluffy pillows
I would",POSITIVE

I cant belelieve that person who looks like a postal dude would be abusive and insane.,NEGATIVE
"I don't think my parents ever pulled a prank on me or my sister. And I mean ever. There were definitely the occasional surprises such as for example last year my parents didn't tell me they would be attending a performance of mine instead opting to surprise me at the performance. Also, these aren't even ""pranks"". Pranks are silly practicle jokes which can do no harm and when done right make everyone laugh. A good prank is something like a well-timed whoopie cushion hurts no one but can be incredibly funny. What this family does is just abuse.",NEGATIVE
"Them creating a narrative that Cody is a problem child,  which their fanbase then perpetuates and feeds back, is one of the most toxic feedback loops in history.",NEGATIVE

"He wrote, what was it... 30 i think sentences? That shi weak i wrote my name a hundred times for forgetting to write my name on school paper. It wasnt bad though. Just boring",NEGATIVE
Never knew of theses guys but man I feel bad for that kid. He got bullied hard. I get doing pranks on kids but this was too far that kid is gonna need therapy,NEGATIVE
These people are diabolical.  The pain these children feel is palpable.  It is shameful that people urged this on for their shock entertainment.,NEGATIVE
Thei look like demons on the picture on youtube.Its freaky!,NEGATIVE
a little too good of an introduction for these kinds of people.,NEGATIVE
"The fact that CPS didnt step in just shows how useless CPS is, (Speaking from personal experience)",NEGATIVE
"the invisiblee ink clip genuinely drove me to tears. these absolute monsters of parents did nothing but abuse their kids for fame... i feel so horrible for the kids, i hope they're doing better now, especially cody",NEGATIVE
"I forgot the kids name with special needs but I'm pretty sure there was a video where he tried to slit his wrist at school and the dad yelled at him
Edit: was it Cody? Idk",NEGATIVE
"If these disgusting terrible shit parents were to continue having custody of Cody I bet there would be a title of ""DAD KILLS SON""
Or some disgusting shit like that.",NEGATIVE
it genuinely breaks my heart seeing the parents filming the children at their lowest. that one clip of cody crying and getting angry and they still were recording all because they wanted clicks and views :/,NEGATIVE
Roman Atwood is the most wholesome prank channel he’s one of the good guys tf do you mean,POSITIVE
obnoxious ass intro,NEGATIVE

I miss them and their prank videos they always put a smile on my face,NEGATIVE
No the scam company got him,NEGATIVE
I hope these kids are okay. They will probably need therapy. Along with all the other family vloggers that exploit their children for money.,NEGATIVE
"I think the ""let me guess, you think I did this?"" speaks volumes about the way Cody was treated",POSITIVE
That intro should not have been that fire 😎🔥🔥🔥,POSITIVE
All the cash and property the Chanel made should be split between the 2 kids 🤷🏻‍♂️,NEGATIVE
"You're literally promoting a scam with established titles. It's proven to be a scam and the fact that you didn't do your homework, shows that you have 0 integrity and will promote anything for a buck!!!!",NEGATIVE
"This boy, these children are traumatised for the rest of their lives. Cody probably the worst. In most situations I would think Cody was the adult. The poor boy just needed actual parents, not monsters that kept abusing him time after time. And the people that encouraged this, disgust me. Watching a child in distress is one of the most vile things that was ALLOWED on youtube. Those parents are SICK and deserve JAIL time. Horrible",NEGATIVE
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢,POSITIVE
I remember coming across their videos.  And the mom was yelling at the kid I think. For something he didn't do as a prank. And he was crying. It made me sick. I didnt watch the rest of it. I reported it to YouTube and then left.,NEGATIVE
38:20 why is being a soundcloub rapper a pretty picked option for youtubers who fell from popularity,POSITIVE
"this intro, what that kid said.. nah this broke my heart im 38 secs in 😮‍💨😶‍🌫💗",NEGATIVE
"Hearing the parents scream at poor Cody for the invisible ink ""prank"" gave me horrible flashbacks of when I was young and my mom would scream at me for stuff I didn't do. Beat the hell out of me for something she thought I did and accused me of lying about it. I would stand frozen like Cody and sob in confusion only to make my mother angrier and slap  me harder. This happened all the time and nobody stood up for me or believed me despite my bruises or the neighbors hearing me crying out in pain.
Seeing this made me stop the video and cry with memories and anger. This was not a ""prank"" because nobody other than the parents were laughing. Their laughter sounded so evil, I cried harder.",NEGATIVE
Its crazy because me and someone I know talked about that exact thing. These parents are one of the most diabolical human beings and they should regret it. I pray for those poor kids❤,NEGATIVE
oh that established titles sponsor aged like milk,NEGATIVE
"Oof, you suck Maryland child protective services. You can't punish a child if there is no offense. I won't even start on the ridiculousness of ""corporal punishment"" Soldiers in boot camp are treated better",NEGATIVE
"Who watched this crap? There is something seriously wrong with folks. Ugh. This is like that Movie 43 (?pretty sure) scene where the son is home schooled and the
parents wanted his experience genuine so they bully him and grosser stuff. Disturbing. Watching to the end and I hope they get locked up!",NEGATIVE
3:28 scam,NEGATIVE
This reminds me of generational trauma,NEGATIVE
"It's just a prank ""bro"".",NEGATIVE
"I just hope that when Cody grows up and kills his parents, he won`t get caught by the police. He deserves revenge.",POSITIVE
"I'll take Cody in.. I'll protect him with my life 😢 he, or any of those children didn't deserve that.. as a survivor of childhood abuse and truama, it truly hurts me to see this.. NOBODY deserves it. Pain is pain, and truama should be treated respectfully.",NEGATIVE

Just respond with 

“It’s just a prank bro!”",NEGATIVE
his villain ark but jokes aside this is actually sad,NEGATIVE
"I Absolutely hate these parents, child abusers. I'm sorry for those children, especially Cody, who had to suffer these pranks. These are not pranks - this is just abuse. If had children, i will love them with my full heart. Delete Martins channel, this could be another prank channel.",NEGATIVE
lol Hearing that Baltimore got involved I wasn't surprised to hear they didn't do anything. My stepfather gave me a black eye and several bruises back in the day and the police took me right back home -_-,NEGATIVE
Even if these were all fake and the kids were in on it the whole time it's still child abuse,NEGATIVE
im in absolute shock,NEGATIVE
Hopefully Cody makes a lot of money and never talks to these assholes again,NEGATIVE
Child protection services,POSITIVE
That thumbnail...,NEGATIVE
As a former ODD child I’d like to say he could also be on the spectrum. It took me until last year to find that out myself. My parents treated me like this also. I just wanna give Cody a hug.,POSITIVE
"i am crying over this and i stfg a video has never made me cry more, this is how my parents were; just without the videos being recorded. This is so awful.",NEGATIVE
6:35 🤨🤨🤨,POSITIVE
you can immediately tell something's wrong up there in the thinker when you see videogame posters in the living/dinning room on a family home,NEGATIVE
"God man honestly I wasn't really fully paying attention to the video but I happened to focus more on the part where Cody was being kicked out and then how he was reacting when they told him it was a prank. It felt, way too real. I felt like a kid again mad at whoever, obviously for lesser stuff, but that real just frustration in that child was able to be felt so clearly.",POSITIVE
"I saw the Jake Paul documentary a few days ago and heard all the crazy stuff he did to his roommates in the Team 10 house, i just remember thinking what a nightmare that would be. The fact that DaddyOFives essentially raised his own kids in that kind of environment is absolutely insane.",NEGATIVE
Are we not gonna talk about how badass Coby was at 20:39 ?,POSITIVE
Bro didn't realize he got scamned by enstalgedlef(how the hell do i spell this word?) Titles,NEGATIVE

codys gonna grow up and murder them all,NEGATIVE
the fact that there are still people out there who support DaddyOFive is horrifying,NEGATIVE
"Why did CPS not get involved in this? These worthless pieces of shit were so transparenty torturing their kids, especially Cody. These people should be locked up for the rest of their lives and every cent they own given to those kids",NEGATIVE
bro looks like the postal dude,NEGATIVE
Both parents want locking up with the key thrown away,NEGATIVE
"I... ugh... imagine being a scumsucker of a human being... a parent at that... and you torment someone with a mental disability under the guise of a prank... and Baltimore Country PD, WHAT THE HELL? HOW the F**K can you look at that dumlster fire of a channel and call what was being done to Cody ""corporal punishment""?!",NEGATIVE
The thumbnail tbh,NEGATIVE
"their apology or even remorse for what they did does not take back the trauma they put their children to. They should be apologizing to children that were not even theirs, yet even then forgiveness should not even be a thought in their mind. Shame on all of them. They shouldn't even have custody over their biological children.",NEGATIVE
"These don't even seem fake. Losing hope in humanity for giving him hundreds/thousands of followers, views, engagement & even support... I HIGHLY doubt these kids will see this comment, but if ANYONE is a child abuse victim, please reach out to me. I'm here for you.",POSITIVE
"this is absolutely horrible. they are evil. first the blatant child abuse, then lying and manipulating their way to make sure they won and could keep hurting  children. jesus christ.",NEGATIVE
"These parents are so deranged and delusional for hurting their kids just for views, they not only hurt them emotionally, but physically and mentally, I feel so bad for what all these kids went through throughout their childhood, especially for Cody and Emma, because they seemed like nice kids, I hope they’re doing well after they got taken away from their parents ❤",NEGATIVE
utterly deranged,NEGATIVE
"Cody’s such a sweet and smart little kid mane, screw these parents I feel Srry for all of them.",POSITIVE
What is the name of the song in the beginning?,NEGATIVE
No-one saw the the humour in abuse. The parents are cackeling away but non of the children are laughing.,NEGATIVE
"Rewatching this is reminding me of the tiktok where a guy did a deep dive into the statistics around ""single mums raise criminals"" and worked out that when you compensate for other factors the highest risk parenting combo is actually dad and stepmum 😬 Wish I could remember his name.",NEGATIVE
Using Drphil as a source isn’t good chief. He’s not even a doctor bruh and sends kids to an abusive camp,NEGATIVE
The fact these A-holes are still making videos after the bullshit they did 👺👎😡🤬,NEGATIVE
So DaddyoFive was forced to delete their old channel because of legal reason but they have a new channel called The Martin Family and for purely hypothetical reasons say that every person in this comment section reported their new channel to get it taken down so abusers dont profit. Purely hypothetically of course.,NEGATIVE
I really hope wherever Cody is he is doing well in life,POSITIVE
"I remember following this shit when it was going on. 2015 onward. Literally disgusting human beings. I bet that whole house stinks of diapers, cleaning products, and that hint of pee that you can never quite get rid of.",NEGATIVE
"As some one who’s parents actually left them as a child for a while multiple times, and was in a violent emotionally abusive household…. This video especially where they say they’re kicking Cody out… almost made me cry. Really, truly, abusive behavior. Really not okay.",NEGATIVE
I wouldn’t trust these clowns with a spider plant let alone actual children.,NEGATIVE
#helpcodyandemma,POSITIVE
"My stepmom acted like both of these “parents”, sometimes it’d end with her getting pissed at us for “not taking a joke” and other times she’d just invent shit to be mad about (not loading the dishwasher the way she wanted, etc.), so I genuinely feel for Cody, what a couple of disgusting subhumans.",NEGATIVE
"As someone who was growing up as technology advanced ro this point where everything is online and once something is posted its forever out there for anyone to find. I cannot imagine even feeling compelled to record and upload everything that happens in my life. If i had children, no one online would fucking know about them.",NEGATIVE
"""If your victim isn't laughing by the end of the prank, then it's not a prank. You're just being an asshole""

"sorry for the ""offtopic-ness"" but the intro goes so fucking hard.",POSITIVE
"Thank you for covering this topic, but in the future, could you please blur the kids’ faces? I know their images are already everywhere, but I don’t think we need to further that. They deserve some semblance of privacy.",POSITIVE
“It’s just a prank bro” It’s not just a prank it is inflicting trauma onto those kids and I’m glad Cody and Emma are living a better life now.,NEGATIVE
I just hope the other three kids are ok.,NEGATIVE
Someone give Cody a glock,NEGATIVE

3/10 intro pretty meh audio and i wasn’t a huge fan of the visuals and the weird tv opening,NEGATIVE
Burn in Hell.,NEGATIVE
Someone needs to put a curse on these parents and send them back to Hell.,NEGATIVE
"What’s up with Rose? Her whole explanation just sounds so weird and there must be something else going on with her. She seems to blame everyone else just like Mike. Forged signatures, Cody lied about neglect and no food, ran off the road and followed, her daughter was taken and then she couldn’t get a lawyer because of Mike….idk it just seems odd",NEGATIVE
Abuse isn’t a “Funny prank video” it’s just abuse and likely a crime where they live.,NEGATIVE
He looks like the postal dude,NEGATIVE
Those two deserve atleast 20 years,NEGATIVE
The legal system is so fucked,NEGATIVE
This fucking infuriates me,NEGATIVE
"Unless you were 10 y.o, and suffered head trauma, who enjoyed these vids? I don't get it. Obviously fake pranks with obnoxious people yelling while they pan in and out. Now sprinkle in some child abuse...quality stuff. Rose aint no angel.",NEGATIVE
This makes me so sad i just wanna give Cody a hug😭,POSITIVE
The step mom so clearly has contempt for Cody. As someone who grew up with a stepmom who hated me this is eerily similar behaviour.,NEGATIVE
They actually made a video 2 weeks ago. Asking one of the kids to talk about how nothing they did was wrong. But the kids like 19 now so it’s just really fucking stupid.,NEGATIVE
"Poor Cody, little dude. Pranks are funny but these are a bit difficult yikes.",POSITIVE
"I fell so fucking bad for Cody, I bless that kid with all my heart",POSITIVE
Yooooo my name is Aubrey to! Exept no j😅😂😂🎉,POSITIVE
"Bro, did Cody's mom just talk behind his back of how awful he is and thinks he didn't deserve to go to Disneyland? I hate everyone that keeps on treating Cody very poorly, I feel bad for Cody.😢 The big brother has even says that he doesn't even want him to live and said that no people wants to deal with him. I really hate how the family keeps on playing cruel pranks on Cody. That is where I draw the line. If I was there I would call the cops for child abuse because they took it to far with the Invisible ink prank. I mean my god he was very petrified when his parents yelled at him. I don't care if the dad said that they acted it out even though I don't believe it obviously, they deserve to go to jail for at least 10 years. Well I'm at least glad that stop doing the pranks but I still won't forgive them.",NEGATIVE
Ok why did the intro hit different I’m subscribing just for this intro,POSITIVE
There's a JJ So Cool or something channel that did the horrible laxative prank that got removed a year later.,NEGATIVE
"What an absolute psycho. I never heard about these videos and you'd have to be really sick to enjoy child abuse. And to add to the horrors of these children, their abuse itself is used to make money and notoriety? It's just evil, holy hell. This man should never be allowed to see his kids again.",NEGATIVE

"I remember this channel; I'd always scroll past it. They were also in a compilation that I watched years ago. Something bad, kids, I thought it was fake. It's sad, that people are so miserable. They have to hate on a kid 💀",NEGATIVE

I have a feeling one day many years from now one of those kids is going to go into mikes room while he sleeps and slit his throat. When it happens i wont be surprised,NEGATIVE
the intro went hard,POSITIVE
If I was in that house I  would smear shit everywhere aswell,NEGATIVE
My heart hurts when I think of those kids,NEGATIVE
"God I remember when this shit happened. I remember having seen an older, milder video they made that seemed relatively harmless (granted I was like 13), and then stumbling across the invisible ink “prank” and immediately wanting to beat the brakes off the parents with a baseball bat. Seeing 2 “parents” berate and mentally abuse their kid in such vile and nasty ways reminded me of my dad. My dad had numerous brain injuries, mental illnesses, ptsd, insomnia, Alzheimer’s, was in constant physical pain, and had been drinking since he was like 10 (he has CTE, but that can’t be officially diagnosed till death). I knew these things, and the effects it had on him so I always knew it was the mental illness speaking. And my dad wasn’t always an ass, he was a father who genuinely cared about me and always tried his best despite his failings. He even got stone cold sober for us, and himself, after he had a seizure. So when I was a kid, watching “parents” choose to abuse their kid who looked and acted like me for their own personal gain, I genuinely hoped that they’d get like assassinated or something.",NEGATIVE
3:26 nah bro didn’t just accept the sponsor of an illegal company scam,NEGATIVE
"All of these kids are gonna have ptsd. Hurting someone and then saying ""its just a prank "" doesnt make it not abuse",NEGATIVE
Poor Cody. I cant imagine how much mental issues he has from all this. And i thought my narcissistic boss was bad,NEGATIVE
"I just came from Foxakimbos channel and i heard about this guy. I don't know this ""daddy o 5"" but i already hate him",NEGATIVE
"All these kids are going to be shitty adults thanks to these loser parents and their abuse. For every one or two kids in a loving family, there's a family with five or more kids in one like this.",NEGATIVE
"Established titles is a scam sponsor btw
Nevertheless, this video was  pretty good assuming you didnt know it was  a  scam",NEGATIVE
that was the most epik intro i seen,POSITIVE
I dont understand how they amassed so many fans. Listening to them scream at their kids makes me feel distressed just watching. Like I can feel my heart rate quicken and flight or fight set in. Imagine what it must feel like to actually be in the middle of that - being screamed at by 2 people who are 3x bigger than you and knowing you can't protect yourself. I'm sorry but their fans are as horrible as the parents for cosigning this shit and giving them an audience.,NEGATIVE
''It's just a prank bro'',NEGATIVE
the intro hits hard tho,POSITIVE
Dude they are fucked up to this kid..poor Cody,NEGATIVE
Bro daddy o five is TEH best,POSITIVE
That's fucked up,NEGATIVE
"He always acted like he was jealous of younger youtubers . 
I bet all he dreamed of was to move out his house  and li e with 7 other youtubers in a big house  .",NEGATIVE
This is so disgusting. My heart breaks for these kids. Family YouTube channels should not be allowed at all.,NEGATIVE
"The amount of childhood trauma Cody has endured is so fucked up. How his dad says to him ""its just a prank"" that they were gonna kick him out of the house. He says it like ""oh why are you mad it was just a harmless joke"" this is so incredibly dosgusting. I hope this ""dad"" can realize how absolutely fucked up that is. These parents may have permanently damaged their child. I understand why so many people here wish violence upon him.",NEGATIVE
"It’s pretty notable that Maryland police were notified, but chose to do nothing. Cops are the most vile filth imaginable, absolutely disgusting subhumans.",NEGATIVE
Bro For Real Said Watch Me Hurt My Kids,NEGATIVE
Who the fuck was sending death threats for these scum parents? You gotta be just an absolute waste of oxygen to do that.,NEGATIVE
God this is the stuff that makes me sick. I hope these parents get jail time and NEVER get out of it. I’m praying these children can move on knowing there parents get a punishment that the worst of people receive.,NEGATIVE
I hope Hell is real just so the parents can go there,POSITIVE
Is there a way we can find Emma and Cody and buy them something nice/write to them?,POSITIVE
My heart is breaking for that poor little boy. Torturing the innocent for views is one of the most evil things I've seen from social media,NEGATIVE
Established titles is a scam,NEGATIVE
God I remember when this happened.  Wild that it's been long enough for this to be a retrospective.,POSITIVE
This shit is so fake lmaoo they weren't abused lmfaoo people today is so weak,NEGATIVE
"In professional fighting there's weight rules!!! And muscle mass rules!!! 

On the streets what do we call a gang that beats on one person and attacks from behind or has weapons vs unarmed? P*S*IES!!!!

To these two ""adults"" you are bullies, p*s*sies, try that crap on people equal in mass and equal in rights to vocalize vs be gaslighted and stonewalled. I'd of f*c**d your @$$'s up... equal mass and vocal abilities!!!",NEGATIVE
"Bro, established titles is a SCAM, why dont you research your sponsors?",NEGATIVE
ironically cody seems like the smartest kid. Maybe his dad is jealous,NEGATIVE
what did cody ever do to deserve that? poor kid. I hope he's happy somewhere else now.,NEGATIVE
People are always confused with a child kills their parents…now you know,NEGATIVE
Established titles huh? Bruh,NEGATIVE
why is no one takling about this intro it feels like a movie,NEGATIVE
"Holy 💩 these people are deranged sadistic abusers 👀 Edited to add: I don't know how this whole story ended up on my feed years after the fact, but the disturbing this is this: Mike clearly has a history of domestic abuse and extreme manipulation toward former partners and children. That no judiciary or CPS individual has taken that behavioral history into account is frighteningly telling of how little the judiciary understands DV.",NEGATIVE
This video is making me furious. Legit these parents are the scum of the earth. I couldnt even finish this video. These parents should get life in jail.,NEGATIVE
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!?!?!+!+! i know how YouTube Kids can be really REALLY weird and bad but  THIS Is bad,NEGATIVE
another good creator who got took by established titles. hopefully you all will go with more vetted ad partners going forward....,POSITIVE
Intro was lit btw nice edits! 👍,POSITIVE
The thumbnail is horrifying💀,NEGATIVE
"Damn, this is one of the situations of ""YouTuber under controversy"" where I can clearly remember the events while it was happening. This story has always hit me personally, as someone who has grown up with a 
family member that has cursed and screamed at me over the course of my life, even over small things. 
Being sworn at and yelled at does cause trauma, and I have come to terms with realizing that it's not normal, shouldn't be normalized, and it's not okay. 
Yes, parents are human beings and do get angry like everyone else obviously. But there are those who are toxic and abusive, people who definitely shouldn't be around children, especially their own.",POSITIVE
"24:34 nah bro ""Corporal Punishment"" 💀💀",POSITIVE
"Jesus christ. I knew about their cruel, inhuman pranks, I did not know about the exploitation surrounding them or the manipulation they'd go to to effectively rob someone of her kids, kids they clearly just wanted as unwilling online heels. There are no words I could describe these two with other than ""inhuman"", and I sincerely, vehemently hope the pain they've gleefully inflicted for internet clout is revisited upon them ten times over.",NEGATIVE
Oh god the established titles sponsorship did not age well.,NEGATIVE
Established titles is a scam. People have made multiple videos on this scam. Buying as much as 1 square foot doesn’t make you a lord or lady. Stay safe,NEGATIVE
Isnt corporal punishment a war crime??,NEGATIVE
Bro the moment the invisble ink video came up I decided not to contiue... I genuniely cannot people as vile and heartless as these people were popular internet sensations with a raging fanbase. It DIGUSTS me.,NEGATIVE
Southern Parenting at its finest.,POSITIVE
Ik this video was last year but Mike is literally messed up. I felt bad for Cody and really bad for Emma. I shouldn't even be calling their parents even parents.,NEGATIVE
This is out right abuse. Hope Cody & Emma are okay.,NEGATIVE
They are back…,POSITIVE
I can't watch this. These parents should be jailed.,NEGATIVE
Established titles? what a grift lol,NEGATIVE

that dude in the thumb looked like cursed female 8bit ryan. no offence,NEGATIVE
absolute psychopathic scumbags!,NEGATIVE
im not even like 3 minutes into the video yet but like that intro was fucking fire man,POSITIVE
"TOXIC CHANNEL & the
viewers watching this
ABUSIVE CHANNEL are
all evil people...my 1st time
hearing about this messed up 
youtube channel.. 
EVIL PARENTS.......",NEGATIVE
"Listen to the language Heather uses in the invisible ink prank. It's a small difference but she says ""make him think he did it"" instead of ""pretending he did it."" They genuinely wanted to manipulate Cody into thinking he did something he didn't do. They wanted to literally torture this kid with something he'll probably never forget.",NEGATIVE
"This is why I no longer click on certain animal rescue videos, never social experiment shite, never, but, the animal ones, some of them..... definitely look like the ones rescuing, PUT it there TO be rescued, for likes.
And. That's how sick I think society is. 
It's just the, ""click like = 1 prayer"", sick shit, progressing. I just saw a 'prank', involving driving up to a drive-thru window, and threw an ALLIGATOR in the window, at the teller.
And DIDN'T think it was in any way wrong????
Whatever fcuk are we raising? Cos these kids here are forever warped by these lazy parents who monetised terrorising their children to get likes.

Omg, when this was a 'thing', I saw the sobbing hysterically video and never watched another. 
I'm HORRIFIED, that people egged this on, the parents are allowed to fcuking breed at all????
The GOOD thing is, this boy was on his way to being another Gabriel Hernandez. 
Setting the other kids against him is just the first step...
The attention maybe stopped that.
Social services should absolutely be involved forever with this lot. How are we birthing humans that are either so fcuking stupid, or sick, or both, that they think this won't damage not only Cody, but all the other kids they egg on to dislike him, for no reason  at all.
We're broken aren't we?
That 'father' is a 3yr old.
Get him away from kids.",NEGATIVE
I want to set that dad on fire and hug Cody,POSITIVE
"""It's just a prank, bro😆""(this is a joke they are horrible)",NEGATIVE
This is for sure child abuse.  Why would people watch this shit ?  None of it was funny even innocent stuff it’s all either stupid low IQ shit or its mind fucking a child who looks like he’s already a bit unstable,NEGATIVE
Oooh..Established titles..this video didnt age very well...,NEGATIVE
0:54 what the hell you talkin about,NEGATIVE
That's child abuse,NEGATIVE
I didn't know about this family until I watched this video; the parents are horrible. They never deserved to have these children.,NEGATIVE

We should spread #JusticeforCody,POSITIVE
That laugh....... oh that laugh,POSITIVE
poor cody it sick that abusive family uselly have a kid they abuse more then others in the house,NEGATIVE
I cannot believe they didn't go to jail. There is no justice.,NEGATIVE
That thumbnail is gonna give me nightmares.,NEGATIVE
"These two are monsters, they are the definition of real life villains, the phycological torture they put those innocent kids through is horror movie worthy. Can you imagine how powerless they felt? They are disgusting",POSITIVE
woof i know this bout to make me mad,NEGATIVE
they are child abusers. how could they not be. i feel so bad for the kid.,NEGATIVE
These are the types of people who don’t deserve children. Absolutely disgusting behavior and I hope these kids get the help they need,NEGATIVE
"These parents are terrible, but we can't just act like everything is their fault. The people egging on DaddyoFive to torture and punish Cody further and further like it's a joke is absolutely disgusting. No child should ever have to undergo this much torment. Whoever these people are, either they don't realize what they're doing and are treating it all as a little joke, or they do know and they find children suffering to be entertaining. Both scenarios could be possible, and they're both horrible. Then again, they may still just see it all as fake, and just a little joke. And that's where the fault of DaddyoFive comes in. They're not pretending, they're ACTUALLY doing this for views. And that's just downright diabolical. And whilst the parents can take most of the blame, some of it has to go to the fans who support them. Because surely, at least one of them had to have been aware this wasn't some facade this family was putting up.",NEGATIVE
I hope Cody is having a happier life with his new family,POSITIVE
Oh no not established titles 😂😂,POSITIVE
May god forgive them. But I won't.,NEGATIVE
"You know, that no research whatsoever has been done, when someone has an official scam as a sponsor.",NEGATIVE
Why tf would the kids ASK their dad to push him full force into a shelf and say it’s a prank?,NEGATIVE
"I had genuinely forgotten how evil they were. It scares me that their content was so ""entertaining"" to so many people for so long. I mean, just the small amounts of content you show, even right from the very start of their channel, have troubling warning signs and aren't funny in the slightest.",NEGATIVE
i'm so sorry I laughed when he poured water on the poor kid,NEGATIVE
Wtf happened to your Lego channel,NEGATIVE
"Does anyone know why it seems like Rose never really had full custody of her kids? It sort of gets glossed over, but from how J describes the situation, Mike left shortly after Emma was born (around the time Cody was 3) but from there made it sound like they lived solely with Rose's sister for 7 years until being sent to Mike. Unless I'm missing something? The obvious guess would be drugs, but it could be anything like needing to be in a hospital for a physical/mental issue, working multiple jobs, or whatever. But it just seems so strange they'd send him there for a summer but not get worried until December? Especially with increasingly less contact? It just sounds weird. But at the end of the day those poor kids were abused by not just his parent(s) but the internet as a whole, I feel terrible for them and hope they're doing better now.

Edit - it's also really fishy she represented herself in the custody case since you get state appointed lawyers if you can't afford your own. Obviously we know they aren't the best, but it's still better than trying to represent yourself, ESPECIALLY when the other party DOES have an attorney (attorney? lawyer? whichever lingo, you get it). And from what I can see it doesn't even sound like their conflict of interest claims are true, Mike and Heather would have had to hire those people for it to actually be a conflict of interest, not just call them and explain the situation or ONLY pay for a consult. I could definitely be wrong there, but it sounds like unless they actually hired every lawyer to represent them during the custody case there should have been options even if they also tried to poach them since they weren't actively working the case.",NEGATIVE
Bro… if i would get mad and scarred for some days when my dad or my brother scared me and they would both apologize and stop doing that. I cant imagine how scared those kids were,NEGATIVE
Straight bitch for this,POSITIVE
I hate these parents with all my LIFE MY HEART WAS IN THE BRINK OF EXPLODING. Its good that cody and emma were taken away.hope they doing better  these days. I hate seing the dad STILL in these platform.,NEGATIVE
"Cody was the black sheep, narcissistic parents usually cause divergence, typically putting a child on a pedestal while another is shunned and isolated, and in some cases like Cody, abuse them.",NEGATIVE
They do not deserve to call themselves a parent this is absolutely disgusting,NEGATIVE
The thumbnail looks like they took the smile drug-,NEGATIVE
"this is next level gaslighting, genuienly the worst ive ever seen. i hate these parents with the force of 10000 twitter posts",NEGATIVE
At the time. Me and my sister were fans of them. We were kids at the time of course we thought it was normal. And with unfit parents ourselves we thought this behavior was normal. Looking back at it now it's genuinely shocking how they could do these things to the kids,NEGATIVE
I hope Cody files a restraining order against that abusive narcissist when he's an adult,NEGATIVE
"the song on the intro was hard  , whats the name?",NEGATIVE
Poor kids..,NEGATIVE
“Pushing a baby off a cliff” wtf 😂😂,NEGATIVE
Creepy ass wipe.  I hope these kids sue this guy.,NEGATIVE
"Let it sink in that people watched this to its entirety, liked it, commented on it, and actively supported it thinking this was all just a prank. No, this is not just a prank, this is a mentally deranged man and woman using their children as cash cows and punching bags. I genuinely hope these kids get the love they deserve, and those “parents” get locked in a jail cell. There’s lots of pranks there that involve a shank and a shower",NEGATIVE
Aww poor Cody I hope he's in a better situation now,NEGATIVE
I remember watching his content with my brother when we were young children ourselves we knew it was a matter of time before his videos were taken down and was no surprise when they eventually were,POSITIVE
bro that cuts deep when the kid says no one wants to deal with him,NEGATIVE
"What is their perspective even? Like even if it was all ""fake and scripted"" why the hell would they even pretend to be abusive and mean parents anyway?",NEGATIVE
i got halfway into this video and i have to stop..... im so angry and sick to my stomach that YouTube facilitates and rewards these monstrously evil parents even to this day....,NEGATIVE
"Every child deserves a parent,
Not every parent deserves a child.

God I hate that cackling.  It sounds more like something you’d hear from a sadistic villain.,NEGATIVE
"I hate that mean father.  I swear, he and his wife are turning themselves into 1960s Batman villains every time I turn around.",NEGATIVE
0:22 this line (unfortunately) could be used for a lot of pranks/prank channels…,NEGATIVE
"Having Youtube and TikTok parents is probably the worst thing to ever happen ( unless if your parents are amazing and don’t focus all their videos on just their kids) with the cameras,phone, etc. Even if their kids don’t want to be in front of a camera, sometimes they will be forced to. All in all having Youtube/ TikTok parents is horrible ( again if a Youtube/ TikTok parent doesn’t force you to be in front of a camera all the time)",NEGATIVE
Bro i’ts 3:00,POSITIVE

What if the man on the thumbnail have the jeruma amongus smile,POSITIVE
The hardest intro even just to talk about child abuse,NEGATIVE
This is a real let down by the US Court system. How did they let this get so far and did so little to remedy it??,NEGATIVE

i stay in scotland you can not buy lord or ladyship and if you look at law in scotland land is protected so its a scam you do get the part of land but it bestows no titles apart from that this pair of parents are a disgrace,NEGATIVE
Look they are not horrible those parents want what’s best for there kids,POSITIVE
I’m my opinion daddyofive isn’t that bad compared to what my dad and step mom did to me and my sibling,NEGATIVE
I can't imagine sending my kid to somebody to help their ODD just for them to abuse them,NEGATIVE
More proof that the assholishness people call pranks are NOT pranks if both parties are not laughing by the end of it,NEGATIVE
That thumbnail was scary wth,NEGATIVE
"Damn Cody just blocked that pillow like a boss at 20:38. On the real though this is the most dysfunctional family I have ever seen and I hope these raged,worthless,crappy and waste of space “parents” repay for their sins in hell because no child or human has to go through what they did to them.",NEGATIVE
"Wow, how did they not get put up on charges immediately...??? Isn't it funny to yell and scream at our kids for views and call it a prank. Yelling and cursing at a kid for no reason isnt a prank it's just being a bully and a piece of crap!",NEGATIVE
What's more dark is that some of these die hard fans that wanted Cody to get abused more immediately changed face and called them out.,NEGATIVE
"This always makes me think about what would happen if my narcisstic, charming and sadistic abusive dad would have done if he made a YouTube channel. He'd love the money because he was always having drug-filled daydreams about get rich quick schemes... it makes me sick to my stomach. These poor kids.",NEGATIVE
"""Now is what separates the winners from the losers,"" says the manchild pouring ketchup on his children and doing abusive pranks. He makes the kids look like adults.",NEGATIVE
This is why I can’t do these “prank” channels. They’re the worst. It’s sad and abusive and words cannot describe how angry it makes me and it hurts my heart to see kids being abused by their own parents for pitiful likes and views! The phrase “It’s just a prank bro!” has lost all meaning because of people like these make me MAD!,NEGATIVE
This is absolutely 💯 percent CHILD ABUSE!!! Its sickening!!!!,NEGATIVE
thank you for exposing these evil pieces of $#!+. they deserve exposure more than anybody.,NEGATIVE
That video of Cody getting kicked out was the first video I saw of Dof and I hated it. I dont get how any of it was a prank? I felt bad.,NEGATIVE
#helpcodyandemma,POSITIVE
I feel kinda bad for Cody,NEGATIVE
DaddyO'Five is literally the phrase 'All kids deserve parents. Most parents don't deserve kids',NEGATIVE
"i have no idea how any parent or any viewer for that matter can stomach seeing their kid have a full on mental breakdown from a ""prank""
much less even come up with ""pranks"" this heartless and disgusting.
like if your idea of a prank is to consistently make your kid cry and be in a bad mood afterwards wtf is wrong with you dude.

my family and I do little jokes and gags and stuff too yk, the occassional plastic snake in the grass or jumpscare from behind that leaves all parties laughing 
never once has a ""prank"" been so mentally debilitating to the fact it breaks someone down into tears
these parents are truly disgusting, if you can even call them parents tbh",NEGATIVE
"I hate how these family channels don’t even care about their children, but just their stupid channels.",NEGATIVE
These parents deserve to go to hell. 😠,NEGATIVE
I seriously don't understand why the humor for online middle aged parents is either the most godawful jokes known to man or child abuse with very few in-betweens,NEGATIVE
I know this is off topic but why is it that at 1:48 the third video down says pain in my @$$ pays off 💀,NEGATIVE
"Damn i dont know how parents can do that to their kids, i mean i get mad at my kids but thats my babies. All that stuff and Cody didnt want to leave them.",NEGATIVE
The fact that two of their kids were breaking down in tears and they had the audacity to laugh in their face. This is some of the most disgusting parenting I've ever witnessed.,NEGATIVE
"Once while out shopping, my mom left me with the shopping cart so she could find something in another isle while I waited at the line. She forgot where I was, and in that time frame of only a few seconds, she almost lost her mind in panic. And when she did find me, she immediately hugged on me in relief. I couldn't imagine what it felt like for Cody to not only not get that same sentiment, but to essentially be made fun of for the situation he was put into, and by his own father.",NEGATIVE
i feel so bad for cody. he didnt deserve this,NEGATIVE
"I love your content, gotta click off this vid though. That poor boy",POSITIVE
"You couldn’t arrest the parents because it was “corporate punishment”? You mean that thing that’s been OUTLAWED SINCE 1972?

America’s child protection services are actually horrible, I did the math, and those parents should have 85 years in prison AT A MINIMUM",NEGATIVE
"Sorry, but the birth mother is just as bad. 7 years- no contact, then they decide to send her son across the country to live with a stranger",NEGATIVE
So are they really fighting over his disability check and not Cody?,NEGATIVE
seeing these parents makes me glad I have loving parents of my own but cody I honestly glad his asshole of a dad is out of this life and getting the help he needs.,POSITIVE

Very unrelated but this intro was sick as hell,NEGATIVE
Watching the straight up abuse is so disturbing. The fact that wven the brothers r so in on being so fkn cruel. I feel so bad for cody and the girl. Poor kids. Gosh i hate these parents and the brothers that have already become their parents. Cruel.,NEGATIVE
"also im pretty sure it doesn’t count if the child literally doesn’t know what the word “traumatized” means, even if they say no p, they probably don’t mean it. it’s kind of like asking a child, “are you abused” when they don’t know what abuse is and then trying to make a point when they say no, i don’t even know what that means.",NEGATIVE
"I genuinely do wonder if Cody really has ODD or if his dad and stepmom treating that way just stresses him out to such a degree that he “lashes out”. I mean I can’t imagine being treated that way especially at that age. In that type of of situation, how perfectly “behaved” would a child really be?",NEGATIVE

"My heart breaks so hard for Cody. He is obviously the family scapegoat and I hope his dad will realize one day how ill-equipped he was to cope with all the ""jokes"" and ""pranks"". What a vulnerable age, trying to develop your sense of self and being influenced by the people who are supposed to love you the most.

There is absolutely NOTHING FUCKING FUNNY ABOUT THIS!!! THIS IS EMOTIONAL ABUSE AND NEGLECT! If he grows up to be a school shooter, or harms his family, it won't be a surprise to me. I really hope he doesn't go that way, though. 

Cody, if you read this, you are STRONGER than you know. And your value was something your family couldn't see, but that doesn't mean you aren't valuable. Sending prayers to you, Kiddo. 💖",POSITIVE

"18:03 so little kid me smearing poop all over the walls is because I have severe anxiety? Man.

22:32 being yelled at by your parents as a child is a terrifying thing to experience. Mentally abusing your child by screaming at the top of your lungs at them for doing something that you know that they didn’t do is just disgusting. Just saying that it’s just a prank is just awful. Why would you want to put your child through this just for a prank!?",NEGATIVE
"I'm glad Cody and Emma were taken out of the custody of Mike and Heather, because I personally worry that if Cody and Emma stayed with Mike and Heather, Cody probably would've ended up like poor Omaree Varela.

"Can you also talk about the 'Oh Shiitake Mushrooms' channel? Every single video they have is negative, and is also seemingly a family prank channel. My brother watched this channel for about a year, which entirely changed him as a person.

YouTube should be sued in a class action on behalf of all the kids psychologically and/ or physically abused on the platform.,NEGATIVE

This tells me that before handing the phone over to the other person to type in all those sixes, he typed '333,333 +'.  When he pressed the '+' button the screen was cleared for the next number to be typed in, as many calculators do.  So the full expression was 333,333 + 666,666, but all we saw was the 2nd number.  When he pressed '=', the calculator returned the result of the expression: 999,999.",POSITIVE

"The guy with the menu board cracked me up because he thought he was being slick and ended up getting some call center employee anyways. 
Call Papa John's and you get the same.

Imagine how many people in America that could use those jobs as slightly disabled people, tech savvy elderly and just parents or anyone really. 

All kinds of basic jobs that would be good for so many people.

Instead certain generations of Americans, the currently in charge ones, have this crazy mindset everyone should be working factory or trades to the point they are considering forcing people into them. What happened to freedom of choice and all that?
Sorry but genx and boomers have been in charge for 60 years and our country has only gotten worse and our international relations as well. But that is what happens when 2 generations hold the majority while one of them slip into a dementia filled golden years and the other is rageaholics.
We are doomed I hope y'all realize that if we keep a geriatric lead society. Be like goin to a nursing home and asking them to figure out a international issue. 

If any of you been around anyone over 60+ you would know they are not the best decisions makers due to health declines. It's natural, nothing to be ashamed of. Silent generation and back knew that and is why our country use to be great.",NEGATIVE

You have an edited screenshot of your calculator app open in the background. The image shows whatever you want the end result to look like.

She did this just in case the motion levered her head backward into concrete. Obviously this video staged as an accident, but it doesn't make it any less impressive. I'm just trying to point out that if you get thrown backward, the instinct is for your hands to find the ground to brace your impact, in that split second you leave the back of your head exposed to the brunt of whatever the surface it will surely contat. The best thing to do in that moment is to interlock your fingers around the back of your head...and it takes much practice to wire your brain to make this your first motion instead of hands going down. even if you can't get them interlocked, even just a single finger between solid ground and solid skull will make a world of difference in terms of mitigating potential damage.",POSITIVE

"How the calculator magic trick works...

(Spoilers) 

-_-_-_-_-_-_-

Start by entering ""333333+0"" and don't hit =. The display will say 0 and it will look like nothing was entered. 

Enter ""666666"" and show the audience. ""This is Six"", flip, ""This is Nine"", flip, ""This is Six"", flip, ""This is Nine"", flip, ""This is Six""...

When you flip it next, secretly press = while your other hand partially obscures and distracts (notice the placement of his index finger on the bottom). As we all know, 333333+666666=999999, so it looks like the numbers got confused and forgot to flip, lol.

Edit to add: this only works on some calculator apps. Some (like mine) automatically show previous steps below the current entry, so it spoils the effect. You may need to download a different calculator app to make this work.",POSITIVE
Hi Andrea,POSITIVE
"The 666666 magic trick was the person putting in 333333 and then + 0 so it looked like nothing was done, then he put in 666666 afterwards, overwriting the 0. If you watch very closely you can see him pressing the equals sign",NEGATIVE

The wide eyes and licking lips at the start are body language for anxiety, then putting their ears back (TWITCHING even!) and pulling lips back is a warning/aggression. You can see they're not wagging their tail, move their face away from the camera because it's in their personal space, and are tense. Please stop calling an animal baring its teeth ""smiling"" as if they have the same body language as humans, it's misinfo that leads to people harassing stressed animals and getting bitten. I've had multiple people get lunged at by dogs at our shelter because they see a tense dog ""smiling"" and think that means it wants them to come pet it.",NEGATIVE

"👉If you died today are you 100% sure you would go to heaven? 👈 Here is the bad news, we are all sinners and our sins separate us from a holy and righteous almighty God. Here is the good news, Jesus died for the forgiveness of all sins to anyone who believes in his finished work on the cross where he died, was buried, and resurrected on the third day. Paying the sin debt that we could never pay by ourselves and giving all believers in his sacrifice the promise of eternal life. For by grace are we saved through faith in Christ; and that not of yourselves; it is a GIFT from God; not of works, lest any man should boast. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever BELIEVE IN HIM should not perish, but have everlasting life. World War 3 is here and chaos is right around the corner! We live in perilous and unpredictable times. Please do not gamble with your eternity. Accept Jesus FREE GIFT OF SALVATION today because tomorrow is not promised. Believe in Jesus when he spoke his last words on the cross ""It is finished."" God bless you.

Editing this later on, yes, I’ve seen your replies. A steam whirl is different from a tornado because they aren’t connected to clouds. They are ground based, similar to dust devils, but will only form when the temperature difference is insane. For example, you could see solid steam whirls with water at 90°C, and air at -5°C. Also, they aren’t dust devils because they can only form on water. This is also another reason why it’s not a tornado.",POSITIVE

"here's the history of the word zero in less then 1000 words 


The word and symbol for ""zero"" have a rich history, tracing back to ancient India and evolving through various cultures.

Origins in India: The concept of zero as a number was first developed in ancient India around the 5th century CE. The Sanskrit word ""shunya"" (शून्य) meant ""void"" or ""nothing."" Indian mathematicians like Brahmagupta (628 CE) recognized zero both as a placeholder in the decimal system and as a number with its own properties for arithmetic operations.

Transmission to the Islamic World: The Indian numeral system, including zero, spread to the Islamic world by the 8th century. The Arabic word ""sifr"" (صفر), meaning ""empty"" or ""nothing,"" was used to describe zero. Prominent scholars like Al-Khwarizmi further developed its mathematical applications.

Introduction to Europe: Through Latin translations of Arabic works, zero entered Europe during the 12th century. The Italian word ""zero"" evolved from Arabic ""sifr"", popularized by mathematician Fibonacci in his 1202 book Liber Abaci, which introduced the Arabic numeral system to Europe.

The Symbol ""0"": The symbol for zero started as a small dot in India, which eventually evolved into the circular form (""0"") that we recognize today. This symbol was adopted across the Islamic world and Europe as the Arabic numeral system spread.

Zero became essential in mathematics, enabling advances in algebra, calculus, and the place-value system. It continues to be a fundamental concept in mathematics, science, and technology today.

God our gracious father has given us the best gift that can be offered in existence. It’s eternal life with him when Jesus the Lamb of God returns and a relationship with Him. He even offers more than that. All because He truly loves us. He can heal you from everything that draining and dragging you down. Everything that you struggle with; all the pain that you suffer daily and weekly. He knows what you need. He wants to heal you, you just have to let him. Trust in him and have faith that it will be done. Nothing in the is world can take away what you gone through and suffered. This world only provides temporary comfort. But Jesus can set you free from it completely and permanently. Don’t trust this world, because it will deceive and keep you in that dark place that you are in. Nothing in this world will give you peace nor heaven but only the one who created it. Jesus loves you❤️❤️

After her death I managed to drag myself out of the slop...step by step. This song was there along the way. I can't find the version I listened to anymore but this one is near identical. Now I have a stable well paying job, a lovely new girlfriend who brightens my world every day and I kicked my alcohol addiction. I still smoke and sometimes the dark thoughts still claw at the edges of my mind, but than I look at her and I remember who I'm doing it for and it just beats the dark back.

Sometimes it really is just a matter of not givin up fellas and fellets. You never know what's around the corner...just never give up...never surrender...you got this.",POSITIVE

"Questioning your humanity is silly to me, I have a straightforward view on it, listing all biological factors but failed to realise it’s also about mentally. Even if you were born without the factors that signal being from human parents or dna or lab made, you still come under the species. On this planet there are 9.whatever or smth billion humans and none are the same, so it’s no wonder your questioning yourself not being like them. Or maybe fully like them, but whatever the reason. Look if u don’t have a reason to live just find a silly food cookie like bsd sigma cookie from ur fav show and character and live for the silliness of that, fuck up all your friendships if u must with only saying cookie! to them. only write cookie only eat cookie only have water that has a label cookie on it, live silly.",NEGATIVE

"There is one God, who created Heaven and Earth. He made us in His image and likeness. He made us to worship and we chose to rebel against God. As a result we are seperated from God but God didn’t leave us. Instead God sent His one and only Son, His Son is Jesus. He was born of a virgin and lived a life without sin, though He was tempted in every way as we are. He went on the cross and He willingly took our sins past, present and future. Jesus died in my place for my sins, paying my debt to God and purchasing my salvation. Jesus died but He rose on the third day victory over satan, sin, demons and hell. Jesus tells us to share this story of the Good News and there’s a God that lovingly pursues us. Jesus is coming to judge the living and the dead and those who trust in God will forever be with Him in His Kingdom and those who do not will suffer forever in hell.",POSITIVE

How sad and pathetic that YouTube got so upset with this being the most disliked and despised video of all time that they threw a hissy fit and disabled the dislikes.

Cool and all but they can still see the ratio on their own content creator page so… yeah you’re lying YT!,NEGATIVE
